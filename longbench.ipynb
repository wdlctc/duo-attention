This process is similar to the cloze task in BERT's pre-train process, and by using the ability of the contextual language model, the decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences. Additionally, masking words in the decoder helps to avoid phrase repetition since the two datasets seldom contain repeated tri-grams in one summary. Finally, masking words in the decoder provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with BERT's pre-training\n"

MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting. The report highlights potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC, including whether to use them more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used, and whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC. The report also discusses the differences between MYP and BBC, including the lack of a permanent statute governing the use of BBC and the fact that BBC contracts can cover more than five years of planned procurements. The report concludes by discussing potential savings under MYP and BBC, as well as potential issues for Congress concerning the use of these contracting mechanisms.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the inventories of selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft and their operating and support costs. The report found that sustainment of fixed-wing aircraft and other weapon systems comprises the logistics and personnel services required to maintain and prolong operations. The report also found that DOD policy requires the services to develop and implement a sustainment strategy, such as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, for sustaining its weapon systems. The report notes that sustainment responsibilities may be contracted out as part of a public-private partnership or a performance-based logistics agreement. The report also found that DOD relies on program managers to lead the development, delivery, and sustainment of individual weapon systems through their life cycles. The report notes that sustainment challenges for the selected aircraft include aging, maintenance, and supply support issues. The report recommends that DOD clarify the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. The report also recommends that the Navy update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. The report notes that the Air Force and Navy have regularly reviewed sustainment metrics for the aircraft and are implementing plans for improving aircraft availability. The report notes that DOD's policy and the Navy's guidance are not clear on whether the services should have a current sustainment strategy for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft, and on whether the strategies are required to be updated every 5 years. The report concludes that without clarity about whether the DOD instruction and the Navy guidance apply to legacy systems, program officials will not know whether they are required to have a sustainment strategy or are required to update the plan for their respective fixed-wing aircraft. The report recommends that DOD ensure that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment updates or issues new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. The report also recommends that the Secretary of the Navy update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. The report notes that the Air Force and Navy have implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability. The report notes that the Air Force and Navy have regularly monitored the condition of their fixed-wing aircraft, which includes measuring aircraft availability against planned goals as well as monitoring other sustainment metrics.

      "Prediction: The report by the United Nations, International Criminal Police Organization, and other organizations highlights the global nature of wildlife trafficking networks. The value of illegally traded wildlife is difficult to estimate due to uncertainty in available sources. The U.S. trade in wildlife and related products includes a variety of species, such as live reptiles, birds, and mammals, as well as elephant ivory. The FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices enforce certain laws and treaties prohibiting wildlife trafficking. The FWS Office of Law Enforcement has a budget of $74.7 million and employs 205 special agents to investigate wildlife crime, including international and domestic wildlife trafficking rings. The NOAA Office of Law Enforcement has a budget of $68.6 million and employs 77 special agents to investigate wildlife crimes within its jurisdiction. FWS and NOAA collaborate with other government agencies and organizations to combat wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA have policies to guide their law enforcement agents on the process for preparing and submitting a request to pay a financial reward. However, FWS's policy does not specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on financial rewards for reporting information on wildlife trafficking. By tracking reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination, FWS and NOAA can better ensure that they have complete information on the rewards they have paid to help manage their use of rewards as a law enforcement tool. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare defensible reward proposals. The report recommends that FWS and NOAA track financial reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination, augment FWS's financial reward policy to specify factors law enforcement agents are to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, determine the types of additional information to communicate to the public on financial rewards and then develop and implement a plan for communicating that information, review the effectiveness of their use of rewards, and consider making more reward information publicly available at the conclusion of the audit.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the importance of cross-border data flows in facilitating international trade and commerce. It highlights the economic gains from digital trade and international data flows, but also raises concerns around the security and privacy of the information being transmitted. The report notes that while the United States has traditionally supported open data flows and regulated privacy at a sectoral level, other countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade. The report suggests that policymakers should limit cross-border data flows in the least trade-restrictive manner possible and ensure security and privacy. The report also notes that there are no comprehensive multilateral rules specifically about privacy or cross-border data flows, but that the United States and other countries have begun to address these issues in negotiating new and updated trade agreements, and through international economic forums and organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The report concludes by suggesting that expanding the Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) beyond APEC could represent the next step toward consistent international rules and disciplines on data flows and privacy. The report also notes that countries vary in their privacy policies and laws, reflecting differing priorities, cultures, and legal structures. The report emphasizes the need for a global consensus on how to balance open data flows and privacy protection to maintain trust in the digital environment and advance international trade.\n"

      "Prediction: The federal government supports the development of airport infrastructure through three different ways: the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC), and tax-exempt bonds. AIP provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. PFC revenues can be used for a broader range of projects than AIP funds, including \"landside\" projects such as passenger terminals and ground access improvements. Tax-exempt bonds grant investors preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued by state and local governments for airport improvements. Airports may also draw on state and local funds and on operating revenues, such as lease payments and landing fees. The availability and conditions of one source of funding may also influence the availability and terms of other funding sources. The report highlights the different funding sources and their limitations, as well as the distribution system for AIP grants, which is based on a combination of formula grants and discretionary funds. The report also discusses the federal government's interest in implementing federal safety and noise policies, and the disagreements about the appropriate degree of federal participation in airport development and finance. The report concludes with a discussion of the current apportionment system, the Airport Privatization Pilot Program, and the ongoing debate over FAA reauthorization, including proposals to alter the AIP grant assurances and the PFC cap. Overall, the report provides an overview of the federal government's role in supporting airport infrastructure development.\n"

The report highlights the importance of project cost estimates in informing DOD's requests for appropriations and congressional oversight of projects. However, the report also notes that DOD's Unified Facilities Criteria, the department's primary construction criteria for developing cost estimates, does not fully incorporate all of the steps needed for producing reliable cost estimates. The report recommends that DOD improve its MILCON cost estimating guidance by fully incorporating all 12 steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable estimates. The report also provides information on the active component's unobligated and unexpended balances of MILCON appropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2016, as well as the execution of MILCON appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. The report also analyzes DOD's estimated initial costs and contract award amounts of projects that had been initiated and completed during fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016 by the active component.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the certification process for postsecondary schools to participate in federal student aid programs. The process involves three requirements: certification by Education, accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency, and authorization by the state in which the school is located. FSA is responsible for ensuring that schools are eligible and capable of administering federal student aid funds according to standards established by Education and authorized by the Higher Education Act. FSA conducts ongoing financial oversight of schools that receive federal student aid, including reviewing annual financial statement audits to assess a school’s financial responsibility and providing additional oversight to schools that do not meet financial responsibility standards. Schools that participate in federal student aid programs are required to submit annual compliance audits, which provide information that FSA can use to assess the school’s administration of federal student aid programs and to identify schools that require additional oversight because they do not fully comply with federal student aid administrative requirements. The OIG is required to assess the quality of school compliance audits and selects a sample to review each year. The report also discusses the certification procedures used by FSA, including reviewing documents submitted by schools, proof of accreditation, proof of state authorization, audited financial statements, self-reported school data, pre-certification review and school outreach, FSA visits to newly certified schools, compliance audits, program reviews, and Education data. The report found that FSA generally relies on compliance audits as the only annual on-site review to determine how schools applying for recertification administer federal student aid. The audits provide direct information collected by independent auditors from school visits and file reviews examining how schools administer federal student aid and comply with program requirements. The report also discusses issues related to audit quality, including insufficient training for auditors, some schools hiring less experienced auditors to save money, and the OIG’s efforts to address audit quality and the information available to FSA staff when making certification decisions. Overall, the report highlights the importance of ensuring that schools are eligible and capable of administering federal student aid funds and that compliance audits provide accurate and reliable information on school administrative capability for Education’s recertification decisions.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the effectiveness of the federal government's approach and strategy for securing agency information systems, including intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. The report highlights the importance of implementing a defense-in-depth strategy, which utilizes multiple layers of cybersecurity and deploys multiple capabilities in combination, to secure agencies' networks and information systems. The report also notes that while DHS has taken steps to improve agencies' capabilities, it has not completed a policy and strategy to do so, or fully reported on its assessment of agencies' capabilities. The report recommends that the Secretary of DHS direct the Network Security Deployment division to coordinate further with federal agencies to identify training and guidance needs for implementing NCPS and CDM, and that the Director of OMB submit the intrusion assessment plan to the appropriate congressional committees. The report also recommends that the Director of OMB report on implementation of the defense-in-depth strategy described in the intrusion assessment plan, including all elements described in the plan, and update the analysis of agencies' intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to include the degree to which agencies are using NCPS. The report notes that while agencies benefit from secure protocols and spear-phishing training, implementing the remaining BOD 18-01 email requirements would provide additional protection to agency information systems. The report also notes that many agencies have not effectively implemented the federal approach and strategy for securing information systems, and that until agencies more effectively implement the government's approach and strategy, federal systems will remain at risk. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach to planning and executing an overall strategy to further strategic goals and lessen persistent weaknesses.\n"

The report shows that USAID has obligated over $544 million and expended over $350 million of the approximately $544.5 million allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in those fiscal years. The majority of the ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza supported the agency's Economic Growth and Infrastructure development objective. USAID also made direct payments to PA creditors totaling about $75 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $70 million from fiscal year 2016 funds. USAID vetted each PA creditor that received payments and completed the vetting during the 12-month period before the debt relief agreements with the PA were signed. USAID determined that certain legal requirements applicable to cash transfers to the PA were not applicable to direct payments made to PA creditors in fiscal year 2014, because no funds were being provided directly to the PA. USAID chose to commission external assessments to determine whether the PA's financial systems were sufficient to ensure adequate accountability for USAID funds consistent with legislative requirements for direct budget support funds. The report also discusses USAID's antiterrorism policies and procedures outlined in Mission Order 21. Overall, the report shows that USAID's assistance to the West Bank and Gaza contributes to building a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the importance of small businesses in job growth and the challenges they face in accessing sufficient capital to start, continue, or expand operations. The federal government has enacted several laws to enhance small business access to capital, including the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) program. The SBLF was designed to increase lending to small businesses and create jobs by providing temporary authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to make capital investments in eligible institutions. The program's advocates argued that it would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. However, opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for TARP recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the SBLF's implementation by the Department of the Treasury and a discussion of bills introduced during recent Congresses to amend the SBLF. The SBLF's Legislative Origin is also discussed, including the proposal by President Obama to create a $30 billion SBLF to enhance access to credit for small businesses. The report focuses on the SBLF and examines other arguments that were presented both for and against the program's enactment. The report also includes a discussion of the supply and demand for small business loans, as well as the amount of outstanding small business loans for nonagricultural purposes as of June 30 of each year from 2006 to 2018. The report concludes that congressional oversight of the SBLF is currently focused on the program's potential long-term costs and effects on small business lending. Underlying those concerns are fundamental disagreements regarding the best way to assist small businesses. Some advocate the provision of additional federal resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. The report concludes that the SBLF's performance has been mixed, with some financial commentators expressing a somewhat less sanguine view of the program's performance. The SBLF's $4.0 billion in financing represents less than 0.7% of outstanding small business\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the Navy's force structure and shipbuilding plans, including the current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans. The report also presents the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget, which requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The report highlights the issue for Congress regarding whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding program and the Navy's longer-term shipbuilding plans. The report also discusses the Navy's 355-ship force-level goal, which was established in 2016 and replaced a 308-ship force-level goal that was in place in 2002-2004. The report notes that the 355-ship force-level goal is the largest force-level goal that the Navy has released since a 375-ship force-level goal that was in place in 2002-2004. The report also discusses the Navy's plans for developing and procuring unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in coming years. The report concludes by highlighting the need for sustained investment by Congress and the Navy's partnership with a defense industrial base that can further attract and retain a highly-skilled workforce with critical skill sets. The report also presents some considerations relating to warranties in shipbuilding and other defense acquisition, as well as some considerations relating to avoiding procurement cost growth vs. minimizing procurement costs. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of assessing the appropriateness of the current or potential future number of ships in the Navy, particularly in light of changes over time in mission requirements, technologies available to ships for performing missions, and other force-planning factors. The report also notes that building the additional ships that would be needed to achieve and maintain the 355-ship fleet could create many additional manufacturing and other jobs at shipyards, associated supplier firms, and elsewhere in the U.S. economy.\n"

      "Prediction: The Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a) loan program provides loans to small businesses for working capital and other general business purposes. The program relies on lenders with delegated authority to approve and service 7(a) loans and ensure that borrowers meet the program's eligibility requirements. To be eligible for the 7(a) program, a business must be an operating for-profit small firm located in the United States and meet the credit elsewhere requirement. The report found that a high rate of lender noncompliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, which is used to ensure that borrowers cannot obtain credit through a conventional lender at reasonable terms. SBA does not require its reviewers to document their assessment of lenders' policies and practices for complying with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, which hinders its ability to take informed and effective actions to improve lender compliance with the requirement and ensure that the program is reaching its intended population. The report recommends that SBA require reviewers to consistently document their assessments of a lender's policies and practices, use its on-site and off-site reviews to routinely collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria as part of its monitoring of lender practices related to the credit elsewhere requirement, and analyze information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria obtained from its reviews to identify lenders that may be at greater risk of noncompliance and inform its selection of lenders for further review for credit elsewhere compliance. The report also found that there may be disparities in credit access among small businesses, based on characteristics of the borrower and firm. SBA lists as a strategic objective to \"ensure inclusive entrepreneurship by expanding access and opportunity to small businesses and entrepreneurs in communities where market gaps remain.\" The report notes that a majority of loan dollars guaranteed under the 7(a) program went to small businesses that were new, partially or wholly owned by women, or located in a distressed area.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and its impact on federal agencies' focus on results-oriented management. The report highlights the importance of using performance information in decision making and the need for agencies to expand the use of performance information at lower levels within agencies. The report also discusses the role of various organizations and officials in improving performance management, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Chief Operating Officers (COOs), Performance Improvement Officers (PIOs), and the Performance Improvement Council (PIC). The report recommends that OMB work with the PIC to identify and share proven practices for increasing the use of performance information at lower levels within agencies, as well as challenges that may be hampering agencies' ability to do so. The report also recommends that OMB ensure future updates to the action plan for the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset Cross-Agency Priority Goal provide additional details on improving the use of data, including performance information, more extensively within federal agencies. Overall, the report emphasizes the need for federal agencies to prioritize the use of performance information in decision making and to take actions to enhance its use more extensively within agencies and government-wide.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the implementation of telework in federal agencies and its impact on reducing office space needs. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 requires agencies to incorporate telework into their continuity of operations plans and designate a Telework Managing Officer. The report also highlights the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in assessing whether agencies have met their telework outcome goals, such as real estate savings. The report notes that while the Act does not mention telework specifically in the context of space planning, agencies can strategically use telework combined with desk-sharing and hoteling to reduce space needs and increase efficiency. The report also notes that federal statute requires agencies to consider whether space needs can be met using alternative workplace arrangements when deciding whether to acquire new space. The report provides examples of how agencies have used telework to reduce space or use space more efficiently, including the Department of Labor, which closed small offices resulting in overall space reductions of about 16,000 square feet. The report also notes that some agencies face challenges in using telework in space planning, including human capital issues such as negotiating workspace changes with collective bargaining units and managing organizational change. The report recommends that the Administrator of General Services ensure that the appropriate GSA offices develop guidance on using telework as a strategic space-planning tool and make it readily available. The report also recommends that the Administrator of General Services ensure that the appropriate GSA offices complete the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool and make it available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework to achieve office space efficiencies. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of using telework as a strategic space-planning tool to reduce real property footprint and achieve greater space efficiencies.\n"

      "Prediction: The report highlights the risks and challenges faced by federal agencies and critical infrastructures due to cyber threats. The complexity of IT systems and networks makes it difficult to identify and manage vulnerabilities, and the interconnectedness of systems increases the number of avenues of attack. The report also notes that advancements in technology have made it easier for individuals and organizations to collect and process vast amounts of information, which can be used to track individuals and compromise personal privacy. The report identifies four major cybersecurity challenges: establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, securing federal systems and information, protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and protecting privacy and sensitive data. The report provides 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address these challenges. The report also notes that federal agencies have experienced challenges in implementing government-wide cybersecurity initiatives, addressing weaknesses in their information systems and responding to cyber incidents. The report recommends that agencies take appropriate steps to better ensure they have effectively implemented programs to protect their information and systems. The report also notes that the federal government needs to implement a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and improve its oversight, including maintaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce. The report concludes that until recommendations are addressed and actions are taken to address the four challenges identified, the federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist.\n"

The PCO is responsible for leading, conducting, and coordinating departmentwide policy development and implementation, and strategic planning. The report highlights the challenges faced by the PCO in leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policy due to ambiguous roles and responsibilities and a lack of predictable, accountable, and repeatable procedures. The report also notes that the PCO determines its workforce needs through the annual budget process, but systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them could help ensure that the PCO's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. The report recommends that the Secretary of Homeland Security finalize a delegation of authority or similar document that clearly defines the PCO's mission, roles, and responsibilities relative to DHS's operational and support components. The report also recommends that the PCO use the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help identify and analyze any gaps in the PCO's workforce, design strategies to address any gaps, and communicate this information to DHS leadership. Finally, the report recommends that the PCO enhance its use of collaboration and communication mechanisms to connect with staff in the components with responsibilities for policy and strategy to better identify and address emerging needs.

      "Prediction: The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act establishes the process for states or tribal entities to request a presidential disaster declaration. FEMA has primary responsibility for coordinating the federal response when a disaster is declared as well as recovery, which typically consists of providing grants to assist state and tribal entities to alleviate the damage resulting from such disasters. Once a disaster is declared, FEMA provides assistance through the IA, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs. The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. The IA comprises five different programs, including the Individuals and Households Program, Crisis Counseling Program, Disaster Legal Services, Disaster Case Management Program, and Disaster Unemployment Assistance. FEMA considers six factors when assessing requests for a disaster declaration and when developing a recommendation to the President for a federal disaster declaration. These factors include the concentration of damages, trauma, special populations, voluntary agency assistance, insurance coverage, and average amount of individual assistance by state. FEMA regional offices did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements related to each of the six regulatory factors in their RVARs. FEMA headquarters officials acknowledged that information related to all the elements for each of the IA regulatory factors were missing from the RVARs. FEMA has proposed revisions to the six current IA regulatory factors to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed the declaration. The proposed rule also seeks to provide additional clarity and guidance for all the established factors. FEMA received public comments from 14 states in the Federal Register during the comment period for the proposed rule and proposed guidance. Until the proposed rule is finalized, it is unclear how the various challenges FEMA regions and state officials raised in our interviews and in comments on the proposed rule will be addressed. We recommend that the Administrator of FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVAR for each element of the IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary. DHS concurred with our recommendation and described planned actions to address it. These actions, if implemented effectively, should address the intent of our recommendation.\n"

      "Prediction: The Forest Service's mission includes managing public lands, conducting research, and working with state and local governments, forest industries, and private landowners to develop forest land. The agency employs over 30,000 employees across the country, but this number grows by thousands in the summer months. The Forest Service's budgetary resources consist primarily of no-year funds, which are carried forward and reapportioned to become part of budget authority available for obligation in the new fiscal year. However, the Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities for reasonably assuring that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. This resulted in the Forest Service not properly allocating certain funds for specific purposes detailed in the appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The Forest Service also lacked control activities segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers for reimbursable agreements and any adjustments affecting the final disposition of related receivables. The Forest Service's processes and related control activities over review of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure optimum utilization of funds and were inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. To improve internal controls over the Forest Service's budget execution processes, the Chief of the Forest Service should revise its process and design, document, and implement related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are properly used for the purposes specifically designated. The Chief of the Forest Service should also develop a process and design, document, and implement related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year funds from prior years are reviewed for continuing need. The Chief of the Forest Service should design, document, and implement a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds and submit it for review and approval by USDA before issuance, as required by the USDA Budget Manual. The Chief of the Forest Service should design, document, and implement control activities over the preparation and approval of a fire suppression fund transfers strategy, to specify all appropriate factors to be considered in developing and documenting the strategy, and incorporate these control activities into the Directive System.

      "Prediction: The confirmation process for presidential nominations serves several purposes, including examining the qualifications of nominees and potential conflicts of interest, influencing policy through the rejection or extraction of promises from nominees, and delaying the confirmation process to increase influence with the executive branch on unrelated matters. The Senate confirms a high percentage of nominations due to the regularized process facilitating quick action on thousands of government positions, the involvement of Senators in the nomination stage, and the President's desire for a smooth and fast confirmation process. The Senate refers nominations to committees according to its rules and precedents, and committees have written rules concerning the process, including standards concerning information to be gathered from a nominee. Committees also conduct their own information-gathering exercises, and nominees may meet with committee staff prior to a hearing. The Senate handles executive business separately from its legislative business, and business on the Executive Calendar is considered in executive session. The Senate can approve or reject a nomination, and a majority of Senators present and voting is required to approve a nomination. The Senate can also invoke cloture to bring debate on a nomination to a close, and holds are requests by Senators to prevent or delay action on a nomination or bill. The recent reinterpretation of the cloture rule may affect how often the Senate relies on the cloture process to approve nominations. Recess appointments do not require Senate confirmation, but the President usually submits a new nomination to the Senate in order to comply with a provision of law affecting the pay of recess appointees.\n"

      "Prediction: The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program that provides medical and disability benefits to injured workers and their families, as well as survivors benefits to the families of workers who die on the job. The LHWCA covers private-sector firms that provide workers' compensation coverage for their employees engaged in longshore, harbor, or other maritime occupations on or adjacent to the navigable waters of the United States. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), but most benefits are paid either through private insurers or self-insured firms. The LHWCA is a no-fault system that pays workers for employment-related injuries or illnesses without considering the culpability of any one party. In exchange for this no-fault protection and the guarantee of benefits in the event of an employment-related injury, workers give up their rights to bring actions against employers in the civil court system and give up their rights to seek damages for injuries and illnesses, including pain and suffering, outside of those provided by the workers' compensation laws. The LHWCA has been amended four times to extend coverage to occupations outside the original scope of the law. Employers required by the LHWCA to provide workers' compensation coverage to their employees may either purchase private insurance or self-insure. The DOL operates the Special Fund to provide LHWCA benefits in cases in which the responsible employer or insurance carrier cannot pay or in which benefits must be paid for a second injury under Section 8(f) of the LHWCA. The LHWCA provides medical benefits for covered injuries and illnesses and disability benefits to partially cover wages lost due to covered injuries or illnesses, and it provides survivors benefits to the families of workers who die on the job. The LHWCA provides benefits in cases of total disability, partial disability, and permanent partial disability. The survivors of a covered worker killed on the job are entitled under the LHWCA to a cash payment to provide for the burial and funeral of the deceased. The responsibility for the payment of benefits under the LHWCA rests with the employer or the employer's insurance company, but decisions on benefit eligibility and the amount of benefits are made by the DOL. The LHWCA claims process begins upon the report of an injury, illness, or death, and if the employer or insurance carrier does not controvert the claim, then arrangements are made by the DOL for the claim to be paid. If, however, the employer controverts any part of the claim, then the\n"

      "Prediction: The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), provides grant programs to support employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program is the primary federal effort to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. In 2014, WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to require state VR agencies to provide pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities. These services include instruction in self-advocacy, work-based learning experiences, and job exploration counseling. While most state VR agencies have expanded their services for students with disabilities since WIOA's enactment, some have faced challenges in identifying potentially eligible students and balancing pre-employment transition services with other vocational rehabilitation services. The Department of Education (Education) has provided guidance and technical assistance to state VR agencies, but more detailed information on allowable expenditures for pre-employment transition services is needed. Education should establish timeframes for providing states with additional information on allowable expenditures, take additional steps to provide states with assistance on updating and finalizing their interagency agreements with state educational agencies, and develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices. Overall, while progress has been made in implementing pre-employment transition services, additional action is needed to ensure that all students with disabilities are served and that services are coordinated effectively between state VR and educational agencies.\n"

      "Prediction: Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older, and those with permanent disabilities. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance), Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (outpatient prescription drug benefits). Medicare covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services under Part A. Part B covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. Part C is a private plan option for beneficiaries that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits. Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and older. In 2019, the program will cover an estimated 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that total Medicare spending in 2019 will be about $772 billion; of this amount, approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the appropriations process. Medicare is expected to be a high-priority issue in the current Congress. The program has a significant impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders as well as on the economy in general through its coverage of important health care benefits for the aged and disabled, the payment of premiums and other cost sharing by those beneficiaries, its payments to providers who supply those health care services, and its interaction with other insurance coverage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. In response to these concerns, Congress may consider a range of Medicare reform options, from making changes within the current structure, including modifying provider payments and revising existing oversight and regulatory mechanisms, to restructuring the entire program. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare was enacted in 1965 in response to the concern that only about half of the nation's seniors had health insurance, and most of those had coverage only for inpatient hospital costs.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the U.S. foreign aid program and its objectives, costs, and organization. It highlights the evolution of the foreign aid program since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which transformed the focus of U.S. foreign aid policy from global anti-communism to disparate regional issues. The report also notes that global development has been featured as a key element in U.S. national security strategy in both Bush and Obama Administration policy statements. The report categorizes foreign aid accounts in the U.S. budget according to the types of activities they are expected to support, using broad categories such as military, bilateral development, multilateral development, humanitarian assistance, political/strategic, and nonmilitary security activities. The report also notes that the U.S. foreign aid program has evolved over time, with different types of foreign aid supporting different objectives, but there is also considerable overlap among categories of aid. The report highlights the various ways in which assistance reaches an aid recipient, including project-based assistance, core contribution to international organizations, technical assistance, and direct budget support. The report also notes that most development and humanitarian assistance activities are not directly implemented by U.S. government personnel but by private sector entities, such as individual personal service contractors, consulting firms, universities, private voluntary organizations (PVOs), or public international organizations (PIOs). The report concludes by discussing the various methods commonly used for measuring the amount of federal spending on foreign assistance, including budget authority, obligations, outlays or disbursements, and as a percentage of the total federal budget, discretionary budget authority, or gross domestic product (GDP). The report also notes that the U.S. foreign aid program brings significant indirect financial benefits to the United States, including the development of future, strictly commercial, markets for U.S. products and the establishment of strong economic and trade ties in the developing world, using foreign assistance as a tool, which is key to U.S. economic and job growth.\n"

      "Prediction: The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative aims to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact, rather than by constitutional amendment. The initiative seeks to ensure that the candidate who wins the most votes nationwide is elected President and Vice President. The NPV initiative has been introduced in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and has received active consideration in 38 states. Supporters argue that the compact would provide de facto for a single, democratic choice, allowing all the nation's voters to choose the President and Vice President directly, with no intermediaries. Opponents argue that the NPV compact violates one of the basic principles of majoritarian democracy: it does not require that candidates win a majority of the popular vote in order to gain the presidency. They also argue that the NPV compact is unconstitutional or \"anticonstitutional,\" that is, contrary to the Founders' intentions and the spirit of the nation's fundamental charter. The central legal issue with respect to the Compact Clause is whether a given interstate compact requires the consent of Congress. The NPV initiative potentially raises other broader constitutional concerns, including whether the states can functionally obviate the role of the electoral college through the NPV. The NPV initiative also potentially raises concerns related to the Voting Rights Act. The NPV initiative has generated interest among supporters of direct popular election of the President, but it does not appear to have gained widespread awareness among the public at large. The findings of a recent survey suggest that greater public knowledge of NPV might spur popular support for the compact. This might then contribute to further momentum if additional states were to join, particularly populous ones like Florida, Georgia, and Ohio where the compact was under active consideration in 2019.\n"

      "Prediction: The federal government plans to invest over $96 billion in IT in fiscal year 2018, the largest amount ever budgeted. However, despite these large investments, many IT projects have failed due to a lack of effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. The report highlights several failed IT projects, including the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the Department of Homeland Security's Secure Border Initiative Network program, and the Department of Veterans Affairs' Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise program. The report also notes that security deficiencies can threaten systems once they become operational. The report recommends that agencies address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations, including implementing CIO responsibilities, reviewing IT acquisitions, improving data center consolidation, and managing software licenses. The report also notes that agencies need to improve their cybersecurity posture by implementing risk-based entity-wide information security programs, expanding their cyber workforce planning and training efforts, and strengthening cybersecurity of the nation's critical infrastructures. The report concludes that FITARA and FISMA present opportunities for the federal government to address high-risk areas and save billions of dollars.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the ongoing challenges facing Bosnia, a country that has existed in various forms throughout its history. The country's complex political system, which was established by the Dayton Peace Agreement, is a product of the war that ended in 1995. Bosnia's political system is a parliamentary republic with a high degree of decentralization, and its complex, tiered structure includes a central government, two ethnoterritorial entities, the autonomous Brčko district, and cantonal and municipal governments. The Dayton Agreement established a strong oversight role for the international community, and the Office of the High Representative (OHR) was created to monitor the implementation of civilian aspects of Dayton. The High Representative is supported by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), a group of 55 countries and agencies. The international community also plays an ongoing security role, with NATO leading the Implementation Force (IFOR) and the smaller Stabilization Force (SFOR) that monitored security aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bosnia's challenges include its entrenched ethnic parties, which benefit tremendously from the status quo and have little incentive to reform the system. The political class may also fear penalty if serious reforms are enacted and shine the spotlight on malfeasance. Criminal indictments against leaders in neighboring countries highlight this risk. Bosnia's challenges came to the forefront during its most recent general election on October 7, 2018. The Central Election Commission (CEC) registered 60 parties and over 3,500 candidates for state-level, entity, and cantonal offices. Observers noted that the campaign climate was more divisive and nationalist in tone than usual. Despite broad voter dissatisfaction, entrenched ethnic parties won the largest vote shares. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bosnia's challenges also include corruption, which has roots in the country's wartime economy. A 2000 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report stated that \"organized crime and corruption pervade Bosnia's national political parties, civil service, law enforcement and judicial systems. [Ethnic] parties control all aspects of the government, the judiciary, and the economy, and in so doing maintain the personal and financial power of their members.\" Many observers claim that the situation has improved little since then. In 2018, the High Representative warned that the rule of law has deteriorated, while the U.S. State Department describes the rule of law as \"an existential issue.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Bosnia's economic challenges include its poverty and dependence on migrant remittances. The country is one of Europe's poorest countries, and its economy\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the roles of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the judiciary in requesting and collecting restitution for victims of federal crimes. It highlights the importance of identifying and notifying victims, determining their losses, prosecuting cases, and negotiating plea agreements that include restitution. The report also discusses the Asset Forfeiture Program and how it can be used to collect restitution from offenders. The report notes that while restitution is difficult to collect due to offenders' inability to pay, it is still an important responsibility of the judiciary and DOJ to properly manage and oversee all aspects of the restitution process. The report recommends that the judiciary determine why USSC data on the reasons restitution was not ordered are incomplete and take action to ensure that all required information is recorded. The report also recommends that the Attorney General develop and implement performance measures and goals for each USAO related to the collection of restitution and measure progress towards meeting those goals. Finally, the report suggests that DOJ gather information on cases in which victims have been identified and restitution is anticipated but forfeited assets are not used, and any reasons why. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of ensuring that victims receive full and timely restitution for their losses. \n",

The report is divided into three sections: the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Obama Administration's actions, congressional action, and legislation in the 113th and 114th Congresses. The report includes a resources section with related articles, hearings, and reports. The report highlights the DOD's efforts to confront the crime of sexual assault in the military, including improvements to prospective commander and senior enlisted training and a review of the initial military training environment in every service. The report also notes that the overall prevalence rate of unwanted sexual contact increased in all three military academies from 2011 to 2012. The report emphasizes the need for a culture change at every level of the military, from the most senior leadership to the most junior ranks, to address the pervasive problem of sexual assault in the Armed Forces. The report includes legislative action on the issue, including the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which addressed the issue of sexual assault in the military by establishing minimum sentencing guidelines for any service members found guilty of sexual assault as well as other provisions. The report also includes information on the DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) and the establishment of the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel. The report emphasizes the importance of prevention and response programs, including the DOD Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program and the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database. The report also includes information on the DOD's efforts to combat sexual assault, including the establishment of the Safe HelpRoom at http://SafeHelpline.org, a Sexual Assault Support Service for the DOD community. The report highlights the importance of collaboration between the Departments of Justice and Defense to address the issue of sexual assault in the military.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) program, which provides federal assistance for fire suppression activities. The program is authorized by Section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and is administered by FEMA's Regional Administrators. The report addresses frequently asked questions about FMAGs, including how they are requested, evaluated, and the types of assistance provided. The report also explains the cost-sharing component of FMAGs, which requires state, local, and tribal governments to pay 25% of the expenses. The report notes that tribes are now equivalent to states in their ability to request a major disaster declaration, an emergency declaration, or an FMAG declaration. The report also explains the criteria used to evaluate wildfires and make a determination whether to issue an FMAG. The report notes that FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund and that the decision to issue a FMAG declaration is not contingent on the DRF balance. The report also explains the cost-share for FMAGs, which is based on a federal share of 75% of eligible expenses. The report notes that FMAGs may be provided in conjunction with other Forest Service assistance programs, such as technical and financial assistance provided through the agency's state and volunteer fire assistance programs or state and private forestry office. Finally, the report notes that FMAGs may be available to assist with declared fires that occur in areas with a mix of federal and nonfederal land, if the state has a responsibility for suppression activities under a cooperative agreement with the applicable federal agency, and those costs are not reimbursable under another federal statute.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the maintenance delays and idle time experienced by the Navy's attack submarine fleet. The Navy currently has 51 attack submarines, but maintenance delays have resulted in significant idle time and operating and support cost expenditures. The primary driver of these delays is completing depot maintenance, with 82% of total days of lost time since fiscal year 2008 due to depot maintenance delays. The Navy has started to address workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards, but these efforts will require several years of sustained management attention to reach fruition. The Navy may have options to mitigate idle time and maintenance delays, such as leveraging private shipyard repair capacity. However, without a comprehensive business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards, the Navy will remain unable to determine whether the cost of performing a maintenance period at a private shipyard would outweigh the mission benefits of having reduced idle time, additional operational availability, and the potential for reduced risk to submarine construction programs. The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Chief of Naval Operations conducts a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. The report also notes that the nation's investment in attack submarines provides an asymmetric advantage to gather intelligence undetected, attack enemy targets, and insert special forces, among other capabilities. However, the Navy's attack submarine fleet has suffered from persistent and costly maintenance delays, and without addressing this challenge, the Navy will not achieve the full benefit of the nation's investment in its attack submarines, and it risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. \n",

      "Prediction: The Aegis ballistic missile defense program is carried out by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Navy, and gives Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers a capability for conducting BMD operations. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition strategies and proposed funding levels for the Aegis BMD program. The Aegis system was originally developed in the 1970s for defending ships against aircraft, anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), surface threats, and subsurface threats. The Aegis BMD system exists in several variants, including the 3.6.X variant, the 4.0.3 variant, the 4.1 variant, the 5.0 CU variant, the 5.1 variant, and the 6.X variant. The BMD interceptor missiles used by Aegis ships are the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), the SM-2 Block IV, and the SM-6. The SM-3 is designed to intercept ballistic missiles above the atmosphere (i.e., exo-atmospheric intercept), in the midcourse phase of an enemy ballistic missile's flight. The SM-2 Block IV is designed to intercept ballistic missiles inside the atmosphere (i.e., endo-atmospheric intercept), during the terminal phase of an enemy ballistic missile's flight. The SM-6 is a dual-capability missile that can be used for either air defense (i.e., countering aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles) or ballistic missile defense. The Aegis BMD program is funded mostly through MDA's budget. The Navy's budget provides additional funding for BMD-related efforts. The report also discusses the potential for ship-based lasers, electromagnetic railguns (EMRGs), and gun-launched guided projectiles (GLGPs) to contribute in coming years to Navy terminal-phase BMD operations and the impact this might eventually have on required numbers of ship-based BMD interceptor missiles. Another potential issue for Congress concerns technical risk and test and evaluation issues in the Aegis BMD program. The report also discusses the potential for ship-based lasers, EMRGs, and GLGPs to contribute in coming years to Navy terminal-phase BMD operations and the impact this might eventually have on required numbers of ship-based BMD interceptor missiles.

      "Prediction: The report examines the guidance issued by select U.S. agencies to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports overseas. The report also assesses the extent to which overseas officials from these agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and the extent to which these agencies have implemented this guidance overseas. The report found that not all officials were aware of the restrictions and more than half had not received training about the restrictions. Including information about the restrictions in training materials would help make officials aware of the restrictions early in their careers and prompt them to seek guidance if a tobacco-related issue arises. The report also found that clearer guidance would help to ensure that officials will consistently implement their agency-specific funding restrictions. The report recommends that the Secretary of State work with the Foreign Service Institute to include information about the funding restrictions and relevant guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products in its training materials for employees conducting export promotion activities overseas. The report also recommends that the Secretary of Agriculture include information about the funding restrictions and relevant guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products in training materials for employees conducting export promotion activities overseas. Finally, the report recommends that the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Agriculture, assess the interagency guidance cable on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas and update it to address ambiguities, as needed. The report concludes that the United States exported over $2 billion in tobacco and tobacco-related products in 2017, and Congress has enacted restrictions on the use of certain appropriated funds to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco or tobacco products since the 1990s. The report also notes that State, Commerce, and USDA have developed and updated guidance to implement these restrictions.

The medical centers lacked documentation showing that one type of review, focused professional practice evaluations (FPPE) for cause, had been conducted for 26 providers after concerns had been raised about their care. Additionally, VA medical center officials confirmed that FPPEs for cause that were required for another 21 providers were never conducted. The report also found that the five selected VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providers' clinical care in a timely manner. The report recommended that VHA require documentation of all reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised, establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. The report also found that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards are reported. The report recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely. VA concurred with these recommendations and plans to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers' reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns have been raised.\n"

      "Prediction: The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review certain types of federal agency actions that fall under the statutory category of \"rules.\" Enacted in 1996 as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the CRA requires agencies to report the issuance of \"rules\" to Congress and provides Congress with special procedures under which to consider legislation to overturn those rules. A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. For an agency's action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a \"rule\" as defined by the statute. The class of rules covered by the CRA is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA's) notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The report describes what types of agency actions can be overturned using the CRA by providing a close examination and discussion of the statutory definition of \"rule.\" The report then explains how Members can use the CRA to overturn agency rules that have not been submitted to Congress. The report also discusses how Members can use the CRA to overturn agency rules that have not been submitted to Congress, and how GAO opinions facilitate congressional review of rules that were not—but should have been—submitted under the CRA.

      "Prediction: The report highlights the challenges faced by the VA in aligning its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. The aging infrastructure, geographic shifts in the veterans' population, and changes in health care delivery have all contributed to this challenge. The report also notes that the VA has not consistently engaged with stakeholders, which has resulted in adversarial relationships that have reduced the VA's ability to better align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. The report recommends that the VA improve stakeholder communication guidance and evaluate its efforts. The report also notes that the VAIP process has limitations, as it assumes all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities, which is not accurate given that the VA can provide care directly through its medical facilities or purchase health care services from non-VA providers. The report suggests that the VA should assess the value of the VAIP's facility master plans as a facility-planning tool and either discontinue the development of VAIP's facility master plans or address the limitations of VAIP's facility master plans. The report also notes that the VA has not consistently followed best practices for effectively engaging stakeholders, which has reduced the VA's ability to better align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. The report recommends that the VA improve stakeholder communication guidance and evaluate its efforts.

      "Prediction: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been struggling with internal control and financial management system deficiencies since its creation in 2003. These deficiencies have hindered DHS's ability to manage operations effectively and have led to the designation of DHS's management functions, including financial management, as high risk. To address these deficiencies, DHS has initiated a decentralized approach to upgrade or replace legacy financial management systems and has been evaluating various options for modernizing them, including the use of Shared Service Providers (SSPs). The TRIO project has focused on migrating the financial management systems of Coast Guard, DNDO, and TSA to a modernized solution provided by IBC. However, the TRIO project has faced significant challenges, including concerns about IBC's experience and capacity to handle a modernization project involving agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA. The TRIO project has also experienced delays in completing various tasks and milestones, including providing design phase technical documentation and meeting proposed baseline schedules for implementing Coast Guard and TSA on the modernized IBC solution. The TRIO project has also faced challenges related to complex requirements, project costs, and project management and communication. To address these challenges, DHS and IBC have taken various actions, including establishing a Joint Program Management Office to serve as the overarching program management for DHS financial systems modernization projects. The TRIO project represents a key element of DHS's efforts to address long-standing deficiencies in its financial management systems and further improve financial management. However, without greater adherence to best practices for analyzing alternatives and managing project risks, DHS continues to face increased risk that its financial management system modernization project will not provide reasonable assurance of achieving its mission objectives. GAO recommends that DHS develop and implement effective processes and improve guidance to reasonably assure that future AAs fully follow AOA process best practices and reflect the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process. GAO also recommends that DHS improve the Risk Management Planning Handbook and other relevant guidance for managing risks associated with financial management system modernization projects to fully incorporate risk management best practices. DHS concurred with these recommendations and provided details on its implementation of the recommendations.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the effectiveness of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in improving taxpayer compliance and reducing tax evasion by U.S. persons holding investments in offshore accounts. The report finds that while FATCA has improved visibility into taxable income from foreign sources and enhanced the IRS's ability to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance, there are still challenges in collecting complete and valid Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) from foreign financial institutions (FFIs). The report also identifies overlap in foreign financial asset reporting requirements between FATCA and the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA), which results in most taxpayers filing both forms. The report recommends that the IRS develop a plan to mitigate risks with compliance activities due to the lack of accurate and complete TINs of U.S. account holders collected from FFIs, ensure that appropriate business units have access to consistent and complete data collected from Forms 8938 and tax returns filed by individuals, and employ a comprehensive plan for managing efforts to leverage FATCA data in agency compliance efforts. The report also recommends that Treasury lead efforts, in coordination with the Department of State and the Social Security Administration, to establish a formal means to collaboratively address ongoing issues that U.S. persons living abroad encounter from implementation of FATCA reporting requirements. Overall, the report highlights the need for effective collaboration between agencies to address the challenges faced by U.S. persons living abroad from FATCA implementation.\n"

      "Prediction: The report provides an overview of war-related and other international emergency or contingency-designated funding since FY2001. Since the 9/11 attacks, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated for emergencies or OCO/GWOT in support of the broad U.S. government response to the attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This includes $1.8 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD), $154 billion for the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard. The report also discusses the use of supplemental appropriations and emergency or OCO/GWOT designation, and how it has shifted over time to accommodate the strategic, budgetary, and political needs of the moment. The report notes that while OCO funding enables a flexible and timely response to an emergency or contingency, critics argue that it has become a \"slush fund\" for military and foreign affairs spending unrelated to contingency operations. The report also discusses the use of OCO funding for base-budget requirements and how it has not decreased at the same rate as the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria has decreased. The report concludes by discussing the potential impact of any new contingencies or conflicts on DOD assumptions about OCO needs and the need for Congress to properly question the DOD budget planners on the future of OCO. \n",

The eastern DRC has been plagued by violence, often perpetrated against civilians by illegal armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military. The report also discusses the use of conflict minerals, specifically tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, in various industries. The SEC adopted a conflict minerals disclosure rule in response to Section 1502(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires companies to disclose their use of conflict minerals originating from the DRC and covered countries. The report analyzes the conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 and found that almost all companies that filed conflict minerals disclosures in 2017 reported performing inquiries about their conflict minerals’ country of origin. The report also discusses the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and neighboring countries, including population-based survey data and case-file data. The report concludes that while progress has been made in addressing conflict minerals, more needs to be done to address sexual violence in the region.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the challenges faced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in accurately measuring broadband access on tribal lands. The FCC collects data on broadband availability through the Form 477 process, but this data does not accurately or completely measure broadband access on tribal lands. The report identifies several limitations in the FCC's data collection process, including the overstatement of broadband access on tribal lands due to the Form 477's mobile broadband data collection methods, the lack of clear guidance from FCC regarding how to determine where broadband is available, and the fact that the Form 477 collects fixed broadband data that are not sufficiently granular to accurately depict broadband availability on tribal lands. The report also notes that FCC does not collect data on several factors that can affect broadband access, such as affordability, service quality, and service denials. The report recommends that the FCC develop and implement methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, develop a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data, and obtain feedback from both tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of FCC's tribal engagement guidance. The report also notes that the FCC's lack of a formal process to obtain tribal input on its broadband data is missing an important source of information regarding areas in which the data may overstate broadband service on tribal lands. By taking steps to address these limitations and to collect data that more accurately and completely depict broadband access on tribal lands, the FCC would have greater assurance that it is making progress on reducing the digital divide on tribal lands and targeting broadband funding to tribal lands most in need. Without taking these steps, the FCC increases the risk that residents living on tribal lands will continue to lack broadband access.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the regulatory burden faced by community banks and credit unions, and the actions taken by federal regulators to reduce this burden. The report identifies three sets of regulations that community banks and credit unions find most burdensome: HMDA, BSA/AML, and TRID. These regulations are complex and time-consuming to comply with, and require additional staff training and resources. The report also notes that while regulators have taken steps to reduce the burden associated with these regulations, CFPB has not assessed the effectiveness of its TRID guidance. The report recommends that CFPB assess the effectiveness of its TRID guidance and provide public information on its plans for reviewing regulations applicable to banks and credit unions. The report also recommends that federal depository institution regulators develop plans for conducting quantitative analysis and evaluations that identify opportunities to streamline bodies of regulation. The report concludes that while new financial regulations have helped protect mortgage borrowers and increase the safety and soundness of the financial system, they also entail compliance burdens, particularly for smaller institutions. The report suggests that addressing these limitations in the EGRPRA process could make the analyses the regulators perform more transparent and potentially result in additional burden reduction.\n"

      "Prediction: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awards many different types of grants to state, local, and tribal governments and nongovernmental entities. These grants are to help communities prevent, prepare for, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from disasters and terrorist attacks. FEMA's Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program is intended to modernize and streamline the agency's grants management environment. The program established a standard framework intended to represent a common grants management lifecycle. The framework consists of five sequential phases—pre-award, award, post-award, closeout, and post-closeout—along with a sixth phase dedicated to continuous grant program management activities, such as analyzing data and producing reports on grant awards and managing IT systems. FEMA also established 43 distinct business functions associated with these six lifecycle phases. The program is expected to be implemented within the complex IT environment that currently exists at FEMA. The program is executed by a program management office, which is overseen by a program manager and program executive. The program office resides within the Office of Response and Recovery, which is headed by an Associate Administrator who reports to the FEMA Administrator. In addition, the GMM program executive (who is also the Regional Administrator for FEMA Region IX) reports directly to the FEMA Administrator. GMM is designated as a level 2 major acquisition, which means that it is subject to oversight by the DHS acquisition review board. The board is chaired by the DHS Undersecretary for Management and is made up of executive-level members, such as the DHS Chief Information Officer. The acquisition review board serves as the departmental executive board that decides whether to approve GMM through key acquisition milestones and reviews the program's progress and its compliance with approved documentation every 6 months. The board approved the acquisition program baseline for GMM in May 2017 (i.e., estimated costs to be about $251 million and full operational capability to be achieved by September 2020). In addition, the program is reviewed on a monthly basis by FEMA's Grants Management Executive Steering Group. This group is chaired by the Deputy Administrator of FEMA. Further, DHS's Financial Systems Modernization Executive Steering Committee, chaired by the DHS Chief Financial Officer, meets monthly and is to provide guidance, oversight, and support to GMM. For government organizations, including FEMA, cybersecurity is a key element in maintaining the public trust. Inadequately protected systems may be vulnerable to insider threats. Such systems are also vulnerable to the risk of intrusion by individuals or groups with malicious intent\n"

      "Prediction: The Clean Water Act authorizes the federal program to aid municipal wastewater treatment plant construction and related eligible activities. Congress established this program in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. The federal share of project costs was reduced from 75% to 55% in 1981. The Reagan Administration sought a phaseout of the act's construction grants program by 1990. The 1987 amendments authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction through a combination of the Title II grants program and a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds program. The CWSRF program was phased in beginning in FY1989 and entirely replaced the previous Title II program in FY1991. The CWSRF authorizations for appropriations provided in the 1987 amendments expired in FY1994, but pressure to extend federal funding has continued. Congress has continued to appropriate funds to assist states and localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs and complying with CWA requirements. The federal percentage share and local match required on special purpose grants varied depending on the project and the year of funding. The practice of earmarking special purpose grants in appropriations bills was criticized because designated projects were arguably receiving more favorable treatment than other communities' projects.

      "Prediction: The report examines how prices compare for selected categories of consumer goods that are differentiated for men and women, and potential reasons for any significant price differences. It also looks at what is known about the extent to which men and women may pay different prices in, or experience different levels of access to, markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated based on gender. Additionally, the report explores the federal role in overseeing gender-related price differences and state and local government efforts to address concerns about gender-related price differences. The report finds that in 5 out of 10 personal care product categories, women's versions of the product on average sold for a higher price per ounce or count than men's and these differences were statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level for 4 products and at the 90 percent level for one product. The report also notes that while there is no federal law expressly prohibiting businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar consumer goods and services targeted to men and women, consumer protection laws do prohibit sex discrimination in credit and real estate transactions. The report concludes that while there is evidence of gender-related price differences, it is difficult to determine the extent to which these differences are due to gender bias as opposed to other factors. The report recommends that federal agencies continue to monitor consumer complaints related to violations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, and that state and local governments continue to pass laws or ordinances to prohibit businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar goods or services solely based on gender. The report also suggests that consumers should be aware of potential price differences related to gender and take steps to compare prices and product characteristics before making a purchase. Overall, the report highlights the need for greater transparency and fairness in pricing practices for consumer goods and services, particularly those that are differentiated by gender.\n"

It finds that FERC has a multi-layered approach that involves inspections, studies, and other assessments of individual dams to reduce exposure to safety risks. However, the report also notes that FERC has not conducted a portfolio-wide analysis of safety risks across its entire regulated portfolio of dams. The report recommends that FERC provide standard language and procedures to its staff on how to record information collected during inspections, including how and where to record information about safety deficiencies, in order to facilitate analysis of safety deficiencies across FERC's portfolio of regulated dams. Additionally, the report suggests that FERC use information from its inspections to assess safety risks across its portfolio of regulated dams to identify and prioritize safety risks at a national level. The report also notes that FERC's approach to recording inspection information is inconsistent due to a lack of standard language and procedures, which limits the usefulness of the information.

      "Prediction: The federal government provides benefits to coal miners affected by black lung disease through the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The primary source of revenue for the trust fund is an excise tax on coal, which has been declining in recent years due to a decrease in domestic coal production. The decline in domestic coal production, recent increases in the rate of CWP, and bankruptcies in the coal sector also contribute to the financial strain on the trust fund. The report provides background information and policy options to help inform the debate surrounding the coal excise tax rate and other considerations related to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The report discusses policy options such as increasing taxes on the coal industry, forgiving trust fund interest or debt, reducing federal black lung benefits, and restricting eligibility for miners and survivors to reduce expenditures from responsible operators and the trust fund. The report also discusses the federal Black Lung Program, including eligibility requirements, benefit rates, and the number of miners and survivors receiving benefits. The report concludes that additional revenue may be needed even if past debt is forgiven (or assumed by the general fund), as anticipated trust fund revenues are not likely to be sufficient to cover anticipated trust fund expenditures.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the financial condition and levels of debt in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is the largest and most populous territory of the United States, with approximately 3.3 million residents. The territory is subject to congressional authority, but Congress has granted it broad authority over matters of internal governance. Puerto Rico residents are U.S. citizens and can migrate freely to the states. However, Puerto Rico residents are exempt from paying federal income tax on income from sources in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's economy has been in a prolonged period of economic contraction, with a decline in real output in all but two years between 2005 and 2016. The decline in output has occurred in conjunction with a decline in Puerto Rico's population. Puerto Rico's government has operated with a deficit in all years since 2002, and its deficits grew over time. To cope with its deficits, Puerto Rico's government issued debt to finance operations, rather than reduce its fiscal gap by cutting spending, raising taxes, or both. The report identifies three groups of factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's persistent deficits: inadequate financial management and oversight practices, policy decisions, and prolonged economic contraction. The report also identifies three potential federal actions that could help address some of the factors that contributed to unsustainable indebtedness in Puerto Rico. These actions include ensuring timely, ongoing, and complete disclosure materials to bondholders and the public, subjecting all investment companies in Puerto Rico to the Investment Company Act of 1940, and removing the triple tax exemption for Puerto Rico's municipal securities. The report also notes that Puerto Rico's government plans to take various actions to address its persistent deficits, including implementing an integrated new information technology system for financial management and developing a new public healthcare model. The report concludes by stating that while federal actions could address the factors that contributed to Puerto Rico's financial condition and levels of debt, the Puerto Rico government must also take action to address its persistent deficits.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the four principal programs of CMS, including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and the health-insurance marketplaces. It highlights the growth of Medicare and Medicaid, with Medicare spending projected to reach $1.3 trillion in 2026 and Medicaid expected to increase by 66% to over $950 billion by fiscal year 2025. The report also notes the use of managed-care delivery systems in both programs, with nearly two-thirds of all Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed-care plans and about 40% of expenditures in fiscal year 2015 being for health-care services delivered through managed care. CMS receives appropriations to carry out antifraud activities through several funds, including the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program and the Medicaid Integrity Program. The report notes that improper payments are a significant risk to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and can include payments made as a result of fraud. The report also discusses the challenges associated with measuring outcomes of fraud risk management activities, including the difficulty of measuring the extent of deterred fraud, isolating potential fraud from legitimate activity or other forms of improper payments, and determining the amount of undetected fraud. The report recommends that CMS provide fraud-awareness training relevant to risks facing CMS programs and require new hires to undergo such training and all employees to undergo training on a recurring basis. The report also recommends that CMS conduct fraud risk assessments for Medicare and Medicaid to include respective fraud risk profiles and plans for regularly updating the assessments and profiles. Finally, the report recommends that CMS create, document, implement, and communicate an antifraud strategy that is aligned with and responsive to regularly assessed fraud risks. This strategy should include an approach for monitoring and evaluation.\n"

      "Prediction: The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program was authorized by Congress in 2011 and signed into law by the President. The program consists of two components: converting units subsidized under HUD’s public housing program to properties with long-term project-based voucher (PBV) or project-based rental assistance (PBRA) contracts, and converting privately owned properties with expiring subsidies under old rental assistance programs to PBV or PBRA in order to preserve affordability and encourage property rehabilitation. The goals of the RAD program include preserving the affordability of federally assisted rental properties and improving their physical and financial condition. The RAD program provides added flexibility for PHAs to access private and public funding sources to supplement public housing funding. The RAD program has been implemented and expanded in phases, with 689 conversions closed that involved a total of 74,709 units as of September 30, 2017. The RAD program has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, with some residents expressing concerns about information they received on RAD conversions, communications opportunities, and the relocation process. HUD has not systematically tracked or analyzed household data on residents in RAD-converted units that are available from its public housing or Section 8 databases or from PHAs or other postconversion owners—the main sources of resident data for the RAD program. HUD has not yet developed monitoring procedures for certain resident safeguards under the RAD program, including the phase-in of tenant rent increases, resident representation through tenant organizations, and choice mobility requirements. HUD officials have indicated that they plan to assess how administrative data can be used to monitor choice mobility as part of the planning for a separate PD&R evaluation of this safeguard. HUD officials have also noted that there are procedures for residents to report complaints to HUD if resident representation and organization requirements are not met. The RAD authorizing statute requires HUD to assess and publish findings on the amount of private-sector leveraging, but HUD’s current calculation does not present the amount of private-sector leveraging and does not include all available data. HUD has not systematically tracked or analyzed household-level data on residents in RAD-converted units across existing program databases (HUD maintains household data for the public housing and Section 8 rental assistance programs in two databases). HUD officials stated that they have explored the possibility of transferring household data from one system to another at the time of a property’s conversion. While HUD has decided to rely on resident logs because of the difficulty of tracking household information across its program databases, using resident logs to assess the effects of the RAD program on residents has limitations. HUD has not yet developed monitoring procedures for certain resident\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the acquisition and management of heavy equipment by federal agencies. It finds that there is no standard definition of heavy equipment, and agencies do not have to report on their inventory of this equipment. The report also notes that agencies should conduct a lease-versus-purchase analysis as provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to ensure they are acquiring equipment in the most cost-effective manner. However, the report finds that agencies may not be conducting or documenting these analyses when appropriate, which could result in overspending on leased equipment or purchasing equipment when it would be more cost-effective to lease or rent. The report recommends that the Air Force develop guidance to clarify the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchase analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented, and that the Department of the Interior further clarify in guidance the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchase analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented. The report also notes that agencies should manage the utilization of their heavy equipment, and recommends that the National Park Service develop guidance for managing heavy equipment utilization. The report concludes that the federal government has spent billions of dollars to acquire heavy equipment, and that without greater clarity on the circumstances in which lease-versus-purchase analyses for heavy equipment acquisitions are to be conducted and documented, agencies may not be spending funds on heavy equipment cost-effectively.\n"

The report also highlights the importance of managing the workforce according to several workforce management statutes, including sections 129, 129a, and 2463 of Title 10 of the United States Code. The report also discusses DOD's efforts to better understand the costs associated with its workforces, including the limitations of its methodology for estimating and comparing the full cost of work performed by military and civilian personnel and contractor support. The report recommends that DOD assess the advantages and disadvantages of allowing the continued use of different cost-estimation tools across the department or directing department-wide application of one tool, and revise its guidance in accordance with the findings of its assessment. The report also notes that DOD partially addressed the reporting element to account for the full cost of federal civilian and service contractor personnel by providing an accounting of the labor costs of selected federal civilian and service contractor full-time equivalents for personnel performing similar functions at government-owned facilities during calendar year 2015, but excluding certain non-labor costs from its cost calculations. The report concludes that DOD only partially addressed the reporting provision and recommends that DOD include all labor and non-labor costs in the cost calculations to account for the fully-burdened costs of federal civilians and service contractors, as directed by Congress.\n"

      "Prediction: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established policies and processes for managing its multi-billion dollar acquisition investments. These policies and processes are intended to deliver systems that close critical capability gaps and enable DHS to execute its missions and achieve its goals. However, the performance of DHS's major acquisition portfolio during 2017 did not improve compared to our last review because more programs will require more time and may require more money to complete than initially planned. DHS is collecting more timely cost estimate information on its acquisition programs to make more informed investment decisions. Yet DHS continues to face challenges in funding its acquisition portfolio, which highlights the need for disciplined policies that reflect best practices to ensure that the department does not pursue more programs than it can afford. DHS leadership has taken positive steps in recent years by strengthening its policies for acquisition management and resource allocation, and establishing policies related to requirements. Collectively, these policies reflect an integrated approach to managing investments. However, opportunities remain to further strengthen the acquisition management policy by documenting DHS's current practice to reassess programs that breach their established cost, schedule, or performance thresholds to ensure they are still worth pursuing within the context of the portfolio. Additionally, leveraging information learned once programs complete deployment across the acquisition portfolio could help ensure that programs stay on track against their baselines in the first place. This is particularly relevant because DHS is initiating a number of complex and costly acquisition programs, such as development of a wall system along the southwest border and the Coast Guard's Heavy Polar Icebreaker, which could benefit from this type of information. The report makes two recommendations to DHS: The Under Secretary for Management should update DHS's acquisition management policy to require components to submit a certification of funds memorandum when a major acquisition program re-baselines in response to a breach. (Recommendation 1) The Under Secretary for Management should require PARM to assess the results of major acquisition programs' post-implementation reviews and identify opportunities to improve performance across the acquisition portfolio. (Recommendation 2) The report also provides individual assessments for each of the 28 programs reviewed, including standard elements, such as an image, a program description, and summaries of the program's progress in meeting cost and schedule goals, performance and testing activities, and program management-related issues, such as staffing. Each assessment also includes the following figures: Fiscal Years 2018–2022 Affordability. This figure compares the funding plan presented in the Future Years Homeland Security Program report to Congress for fiscal years 2018–2022 to the program's current cost estimate. We use\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the challenges faced by the Navy and Marine Corps in rebuilding their readiness and preparing for the future. The Navy has experienced maintenance challenges due to a high pace of operations and deferred maintenance, which has hindered readiness recovery. The Navy also faces challenges in completing maintenance on time and providing sufficient manning to its ships. The report recommends that the Navy analyze how it allocates its maintenance workload across public and private shipyards. The Navy has prioritized manning its surface ships homeported overseas, but its methods for tracking fit and fill do not account for sailor experience and may be inaccurately capturing the actual presence of sailors onboard and available for duty on its ships. The Navy plans to expand its fleet by 25 percent, which will likely exacerbate maintenance and manning challenges. The report also discusses the challenges faced by the Navy and Marine Corps in sustaining their aircraft, including depot maintenance complexities for aging aircraft and spare parts availability. The F-35 program has presented additional operational and sustainment challenges, which will likely persist into the future if not corrected. The report recommends that DOD revise its sustainment plans, align associated funding, and mitigate the risks associated with key supply chain-related challenges for deployed F-35s in the Pacific, among others. The report contains 45 specific recommendations to the Navy and the Marine Corps and various other DOD components to assist these services in rebuilding the readiness of their forces and in modernizing for the future.\n"

      "Prediction: The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that insures private mortgage lenders against the possibility of borrowers defaulting on certain mortgage loans. FHA insurance protects the lender, rather than the borrower, in the event of borrower default; a borrower who defaults on an FHA-insured mortgage will still experience the consequences of foreclosure. To be eligible for FHA insurance, the mortgage must be originated by a lender that has been approved by FHA, and the mortgage and the borrower must meet certain criteria. FHA is one of three government agencies that provide insurance or guarantees on certain home mortgages made by private lenders, along with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Of these federal mortgage insurance programs, FHA is the most broadly targeted. Unlike VA- and USDA-insured mortgages, the availability of FHA-insured mortgages is not limited by factors such as veteran status, income, or whether the property is located in a rural area. However, the availability or attractiveness of FHA-insured mortgages may be limited by other factors, such as the maximum mortgage amount that FHA will insure, the fees that it charges for insurance, and its eligibility standards. This report provides background on FHA's history and market role and an overview of the basic eligibility and underwriting criteria for FHA-insured home loans. It also provides data on the number and dollar volume of mortgages that FHA insures, along with data on FHA's market share in recent years. It does not go into detail on the financial status of the FHA mortgage insurance fund. For information on FHA's financial position, see CRS Report R42875, FHA Single-Family Mortgage Insurance: Financial Status of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). The Federal Housing Administration was created by the National Housing Act of 1934, during the Great Depression, to encourage lending for housing and to stimulate the construction industry. Prior to the creation of FHA, few mortgages exceeded 50% of the property's value and most mortgages were written for terms of five years or less. Furthermore, mortgages were typically not structured to be fully repaid by the end of the loan term; rather, at the end of the five-year term, the remaining loan balance had to be paid in a lump sum or the mortgage had to be renegotiated. During the Great Depression, lenders were unable or unwilling to refinance many of the loans that became due. Thus, many borrowers lost their homes through foreclosure, and lenders lost money because property values were\n"

      "Prediction: The report provides background information and potential oversight issues for Congress on the Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier program. The Navy's proposed FY2019 budget requests $2.3 billion in procurement funding for the CVN-78 program. Congress's decisions on the CVN-78 program could substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission proposed not funding the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman) and instead retiring the ship around FY2024 and deactivating one of the Navy's carrier air wings at about the same time. However, the Administration announced that it was effectively withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The report also discusses the potential for shifting to smaller aircraft carriers, which could reduce procurement costs but also reduce capability. The report highlights the need for Congress to oversee the CVN-78 program, particularly regarding cost growth and managing costs within program cost caps. The report also discusses the Navy's decision to show CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission as a ship to be procured in FY2020, rather than a ship that was procured in FY2019, which affects the comparison of numbers of ships procured in FY2019 and FY2020. The report concludes by summarizing potential oversight questions for Congress, including compliance with congressional intent, executability of FY2019 procurement funds for CVN-81, and the impact of the accelerated delivery of CVN-81 under the two-carrier contract on the procurement cost of CVN-82. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of Congress's oversight of the CVN-78 program to ensure that the Navy's aircraft carrier force remains strong and capable. \n",

      "Prediction: The report examines the risk management practices of four federal agencies responsible for protecting their own facilities. The agencies were selected based on their large quantity of reported federally owned and agency-controlled buildings. The report found that none of the agencies' security assessment methodologies fully aligned with the Interagency Security Committee's (ISC) risk management standard for identifying necessary countermeasures. The agencies' methodologies did not consider all of the undesirable events identified in the ISC Standard as possible risks to federal facilities, nor did they assess the threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences of specific undesirable events. The report also found that the agencies did not have comprehensive data to manage their security programs, assess overall performance, and take necessary corrective actions. The report recommends that the agencies update their policies and procedures to require a methodology that adheres to the ISC Standard, collect and analyze data to monitor the performance of their physical security programs, and implement a long-term assessment schedule with key milestones to ensure that higher-level facilities are reassessed at least once every 3 years. The report also highlights the importance of agencies having information to monitor security activities and making informed resource allocation decisions based on aligned risk assessments. Overall, the report emphasizes the need for agencies to improve their physical security programs' alignment with the ISC Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for information and monitoring. \n",

      "Prediction: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has developed the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) to estimate the national Medicaid improper payment rate. However, the PERM methodology does not account for key program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care, such as overpayments and unallowable costs. The PERM measures errors in capitated payments that state Medicaid agencies make to managed care organizations (MCOs) on behalf of enrollees, but does not consider other program integrity risks, such as overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. The report notes that the PERM does not account for these risks, which could result in higher state and federal spending. The report also notes that CMS has taken steps to improve its oversight of Medicaid managed care, but these efforts fall short of ensuring that the agency and states will be able to identify and address overpayments to providers and unallowable MCO costs. The report recommends that CMS consider and take steps to mitigate the program risks that are not measured in the PERM, such as revising the PERM methodology or focusing additional audit resources on managed care. The report also notes that the PERM likely underestimates program integrity risks in Medicaid managed care. Overall, the report highlights the need for better measurement of program risks in managed care to ensure the integrity of the whole Medicaid program.\n"

      "Prediction: The Buy American Act of 1933 was enacted during the Great Depression to create and preserve jobs for American workers. The Act established a preference for the federal government to buy domestic end products. However, there are situations in which agencies can procure foreign end products through established exceptions to the Buy American requirements. The FAR sets forth several exceptions that permit federal agencies to buy foreign end products. These include situations when a domestic end product is not produced in sufficient quantities or cases where the cost would be unreasonable to buy a domestic end product. The report analyzes data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) for fiscal year 2017 to assess the federal government procurement of foreign products, including those procured through citing exceptions and waivers of the Buy American Act. The report also assesses the extent to which selected agencies provide training and guidance to implement the requirements of the Buy American Act. The report recommends that the Office of Management and Budget instruct the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to facilitate additional training to improve the understanding of the contracting workforce regarding the Buy American Act requirements and to facilitate clarifying revisions to FPDS-NG, where needed, and provide training and guidance for recording Buy American Act information in FPDS-NG to improve the accuracy of the Buy American data. The report also recommends that the Secretary of Homeland Security clarify existing guidance in the Homeland Security Acquisition Manual or update training to help contracting officials identify the factors that should be considered in order to determine the applicability of the Trade Agreements Act and waiver of the Buy American Act, document determinations of the use of Buy American exceptions for domestic non-availability and ensure the required approvals are obtained, particularly when such determinations are evidenced through justifications for other than full and open competition, and identify sources of information available for determining product origin and the steps they should take to verify information that is inconsistent. The report also recommends that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs clarify guidance or provide training to identify factors that could help contracting officers determine the applicability of Trade Agreements Act waivers of the Buy American Act, identify sources of information regarding product origin and the steps to be taken to verify inconsistent product origin information, and address the applicability of the Buy American Act requirements and provide instruction on how to implement the requirements, including in any training developed to implement the Veterans First policy. Finally, the report recommends that the Secretary of Health and Human Services provide guidance, training, or other instruction to help contracting officials identify the factors that should be considered in order to determine the applicability of the Trade Agreements\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the evolution of 911 services from basic to Enhanced 911 and the next evolution, Next Generation 911 (NG911), which uses IP-based technology to deliver and process 911 traffic. NG911 systems provide call centers with enhanced capabilities to route and transfer calls and data, which could improve call centers' abilities to handle overflow calls and increase information sharing with first responders. The report also discusses the challenges states and localities face in implementing NG911, including insufficient funding, evolving technology and operations, governance, and cybersecurity risks. Federal agencies are taking actions to assist state and local 911 entities to address these challenges, including developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders. However, the National 911 Program lacks specific goals and related measures to assess its progress towards its responsibilities established in the Next Generation 911 Advancement Act of 2012. The report recommends that the National 911 Program develop specific program goals and performance measures related to NG911 implementation, determine roles and responsibilities of federal agencies participating in the National NG911 Roadmap initiative, and develop an implementation plan to support the completion of the National NG911 Roadmap's national-level tasks. The report also highlights the importance of clarifying the roles and responsibilities of roadmap stakeholders for the execution of the roadmap's tasks to enhance interagency collaboration.\n"

      "Prediction: The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). The RRB covers workers who are employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries, railroad associations, and railroad labor organizations. Lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits; railroad workers with nonrailroad experience receive benefits either from railroad retirement or Social Security, depending on the length of their railroad service. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, although the rate of decline has been irregular and recent years have seen increases in railroad employment after reaching an all-time low of 215,000 workers in January 2010. The total number of beneficiaries under the RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017, and total benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same time. The RRB paid nearly $12.5 billion in retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to approximately 548,000 beneficiaries in FY2017. Almost $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to approximately 28,000 claimants. The RRA authorizes retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families. The RRB determines whether a worker is disabled based on the medical evidence provided during the application process. Railroad workers found to be totally and permanently disabled from all work may be eligible for Tier I benefits at any age if the worker has at least 10 years of railroad service. Totally disabled workers may also receive Tier II benefits at the age of 62 if they have 10 or more years of service. Occupational disability annuities are also payable to workers found to be permanently disabled from their regular railroad occupations, if the worker is at least 60 years old with 10 years of service (or any age with 20 years of service), and with a current connection to the railroad industry. A five-month waiting period after the onset of disability is required before any disability annuity can be payable. Disability benefits are suspended if a beneficiary earns more than a certain amount after deducting certain disability-related work expenses. The Tier I portion of disability benefits may be reduced for the receipt of workers compensation or government disability benefits. In any month that a worker collects a railroad retirement or disability annuity, his or\n"

      "Prediction: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in America, providing health care to millions of veterans and their families at more than 1,500 facilities. The VA's three major components—the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA)—rely on approximately 340,000 employees to provide services and benefits. The VA's IT infrastructure is critical to its efforts to provide benefits and services to veterans. The department operates and maintains an IT infrastructure that provides the backbone necessary to meet the day-to-day operational needs of its medical centers, veteran-facing systems, benefits delivery systems, memorial services, and all other systems supporting the department's mission. The infrastructure is intended to provide for data storage, transmission, and communications requirements necessary to ensure the delivery of reliable, available, and responsive support to all VA staff offices and administration customers, as well as veterans. The VA's IT infrastructure includes more than 576 active or in-development systems in its inventory of IT systems. These systems are intended to be used for the determination of benefits, benefits claims processing, and access to health records, among other services. The VA's VistA system is an integrated medical information system for all veterans' health information. It was developed in-house by the department's clinicians and IT personnel and has been in operation since the early 1980s. The VA has unaddressed needs that indicate its current health IT systems, including VistA, do not fully support the organization's business functions. The VA has designated VA Health Care as a high-risk area for the federal government and continues to be concerned about the department's ability to ensure that its resources are being used cost-effectively and efficiently to improve veterans' timely access to health care. The VA has begun to demonstrate leadership commitment to addressing IT challenges, but more work remains. The VA has initiated four efforts to modernize VistA since 2001. The VA has begun planning for the transition from VistA Evolution to EHRM. The VA has also begun to staff an organizational structure for the modernization initiative. The VA's continued dedication to completing and effectively executing the planning activities that it has identified will be essential to helping minimize program risks and guide this latest electronic health record modernization initiative to a successful outcome—one which VA, for almost two decades, has yet to achieve. The VA continues to make progress on key FITARA-related initiatives. Although the VA has made progress in the area of software\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the potential effects of climate change on migration and stability, particularly in developing countries. It notes that while the exact details of these impacts are uncertain, climate change may intensify slow-onset disasters such as drought and sea level rise, as well as increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These effects may alter existing migration trends across the globe, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The report also notes that migration due to climate change is less common than internal migration, but that people weigh multiple factors when deciding whether to migrate, including economic and political factors, social or personal motives, or demographic pressures. The report highlights the limitations of estimating the number of people displaced by climate change due to the multi-causal nature of migration. It also notes that migration, potentially driven by climate change, may contribute to instability and result in national security challenges. The report provides examples of how climate change may impact migration and stability in different regions, including Asia, South America, the Arctic, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Oceania, and Central America and the Caribbean. The report concludes by recommending that the Department of State provide clear guidance on its process for assessing climate change-related risks to its integrated country strategies. Overall, the report emphasizes the need for greater attention to the potential effects of climate change on migration and stability, particularly in developing countries. \n",

      "Prediction: The report discusses the issue of executive discretion and how it has been at the center of constitutional debates in liberal democracies throughout the twentieth century. The United States Constitution is silent on questions of emergency power, and Congress and the President have answered those questions in varied and often ad hoc ways. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is one such example of a twentieth-century delegation of emergency authority. The report examines how IEEPA grants the President extensive power to regulate a variety of economic transactions during a state of emergency. The report also discusses how the use of IEEPA has expanded in scale, scope, and frequency since its enactment. The report highlights how presidential emergency use of IEEPA has been directed at foreign states initially, with targets that were delimited by geography or nationality. Since the 1990s, however, Presidents have expanded the scope of their declarations to include individual persons, regardless of nationality or geographic location, who are engaged in specific activities. The report also discusses how Congress has used IEEPA outside of the context of national emergencies. When Congress legislates sanctions, it often authorizes or directs the President to use IEEPA authorities to impose those sanctions.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the national pipeline system, which consists of over 2.7 million miles of pipelines transporting oil, natural gas, and other hazardous liquids. The pipelines are vulnerable to physical attacks, including the use of firearms or explosives, due to their stationary nature, the volatility of transported products, and the dispersed nature of pipeline networks spanning urban and outlying areas. The report also highlights the increasing threat of cyber attacks on pipeline systems, which can disrupt critical operations, lead to inappropriate access to sensitive information, and threaten national security, economic well-being, and public health and safety. The report recommends that TSA implement a documented process for reviewing and revising its Pipeline Security Guidelines at regular intervals, clarify its Pipeline Security Guidelines by defining key terms within its criteria for determining critical facilities, develop a strategic workforce plan for its Security Policy and Industry Engagement's Surface Division, update the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool to include up-to-date data, fully document the data sources, underlying assumptions, and judgments that form the basis of the Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool, identify or develop other data sources relevant to threat, vulnerability, and consequence consistent with the NIPP and DHS critical infrastructure risk mitigation priorities, and take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer review of its Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool. The report also emphasizes the importance of quality information for management to make informed decisions and evaluate agencies' performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risks. The report concludes that protecting the nation's pipeline systems is a responsibility shared by both the federal government and private industry, and that TSA's Pipeline Security Branch should take steps to improve the quality of its pipeline security program data by developing written documentation of its data entry and verification procedures, implementing standardized data entry formats, and correcting existing data entry errors. Overall, the report highlights the need for increased attention to pipeline security in light of the dynamic and continuous threat to the security of our nation's pipeline network.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the importance of global defense posture in enabling U.S. defense activities and military operations overseas. It highlights the three elements of global defense posture: forces, footprint, and agreements. The report also discusses the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) and its objectives, which include deterring Russian aggression in the long term and developing the capacity to field a credible combined force should deterrence fail. The report notes that DOD is using a separate process to plan for ERI's posture initiatives, which are being funded through DOD's OCO budget. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense prioritize posture initiatives under ERI relative to those funded in DOD's base budget as part of its established posture-planning processes. The report also recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct EUCOM and the military services to develop estimates for the sustainment costs of prepositioned equipment and other infrastructure projects under ERI and ensure that the services plan for these long-term costs in future budgets. Finally, the report recommends that the Secretary of Defense provide to Congress, along with the department's annual budget submission, estimates of the future costs for posture initiatives funded under ERI and information on any underlying assumptions, such as those pertaining to the level of host nation support and burden sharing. The report notes that DOD's planning for ERI's posture initiatives does not establish priorities for ERI initiatives relative to those in the base budget, estimate long-term sustainment costs for some posture initiatives funded under ERI, or communicate future ERI costs to Congress. The report also notes that DOD's planning for ERI's posture initiatives does not establish priorities among ERI's initiatives relative to those funded through DOD's base budget. The report concludes that DOD risks making decisions that lack a strategic vision in comparison to other DOD priorities and may fund initiatives that cannot be sustained over the long term. The report recommends that DOD increase congressional visibility into ERI's future costs and its underlying assumptions to facilitate congressional oversight and reasonably ensure that initiatives can be sustained over the long-term.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines federal and state Medicaid spending on long-term care, specifically on assisted living facilities. It found that spending on long-term care services provided in home and community settings, including assisted living facilities, exceeds the amount spent on institutional settings such as nursing homes. The report also notes that state Medicaid programs may cover certain medical and non-medical services that assisted living facilities provide, but the Medicaid statute does not provide for coverage of room and board charges of an assisted living facility. The report highlights the importance of state Medicaid agencies monitoring and overseeing the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries, particularly those in assisted living facilities, as they are more vulnerable to abuse, neglect, or exploitation. The report also notes that CMS has taken steps to strengthen beneficiary health and welfare protections in states’ HCBS waiver programs, but the agency's ability to effectively monitor how well states are assuring beneficiary health and welfare is limited by gaps in state reporting to CMS. The report recommends that CMS provide guidance and clarify requirements regarding the monitoring and reporting of deficiencies that states using HCBS waivers are required to report on their annual reports, establish standard Medicaid reporting requirements for all states to annually report key information on critical incidents, and ensure that all states submit annual reports for HCBS waivers on time as required. The report also notes that states have varied approaches for oversight of assisted living services, and that beneficiaries seeking care in an assisted living facility may want to know the number of critical incidents related to a particular facility. The report concludes that effective state and federal oversight is necessary to ensure that the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving assisted living services are protected.\n"

The program has narrowed down the number of participants as it has passed through these phases. NASA has generally relied on the commercial companies to propose specifics related to their crew transportation systems, including their design, the capabilities they would provide, and the level of private investment. In the final two phases of the program, NASA awarded FAR-based contracts. The program established a verification closure notice process, in which the contractors submit data to NASA to verify they have met all the requirements to be certified. \n",

      "Prediction: Colombia has been plagued by a multisided civil conflict for over five decades, resulting in the deaths of 220,000 civilians, 81% of whom were non-combatants. The National Center for Historical Memory report presented to the Colombian government in 2013 provided statistics quantifying the scale of the conflict, including more than 23,000 selective assassinations between 1981 and 2012, internal displacement of more than 5 million Colombians due to land seizure and violence, 27,000 kidnappings between 1970 and 2010, and 11,000 deaths or amputees from anti-personnel land mines laid primarily by Colombia's main insurgent guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Despite the violence, Colombia has achieved a significant turnaround, with a 94% decrease in kidnappings and a 53% reduction in homicides between 2000 and 2016. The country has also opened its economy and promoted trade, investment, and growth, becoming one of Latin America's most attractive locations for foreign direct investment. However, after steady growth over several years, Colombia's economy slowed to 3.1% growth in 2015 and declined to 1.7% in 2017, with many analysts identifying Colombia's dependence on oil and other commodity exports as the primary cause. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Colombian conflict predates the formal founding of the FARC in 1964, as the FARC had its beginnings in the peasant self-defense groups of the 1940s and 1950s. Colombian political life has long suffered from polarization and violence based on the significant disparities and inequalities suffered by landless peasants in the country's peripheral regions. In the late 19th century and a large part of the 20th century, the elite Liberal and Conservative parties dominated Colombian political life. Violence and competition between the parties erupted in a period of extreme violence in Colombia, known as La Violencia, set off in 1948 by the assassination of Liberal presidential candidate Jorge Gaitán. The violence continued for the next decade. After a brief military rule (1953-1958), the Liberal and Conservative parties agreed to a form of coalition governance, known as the National Front. Under the arrangement, the presidency of the country alternated between Conservatives and Liberals, each holding office in turn for four-year intervals. This form of government continued for 16 years (1958-1974). \n",

      "Prediction: The Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 established the foundation for the current U.S. policy to potentially provide federal payment for a portion of claims by third parties for injury, damage, or loss that results from a commercial launch or reentry accident. The act aimed to provide a competitive environment for the U.S. commercial space launch industry while minimizing the cost to taxpayers. All FAA-licensed commercial launches and reentries by U.S. companies, whether unmanned or manned and from the United States or overseas, are covered by federal indemnification for third-party damages that result from the launch or reentry. The FAA calculates separate MPL values for potential damages to third parties and the federal government. The agency defines these probability thresholds to estimate the federal government’s exposure to losses above the MPL. The current probability thresholds are set such that losses are very unlikely to exceed launch companies’ private insurance and become potential costs for the government under CSLCA. The FAA's process for determining the MPL value for a launch or reentry license generally includes three elements: estimating the number of casualties, estimating the cost of casualties, and deriving estimated property damage costs from estimated casualty costs. The total MPL is equal to the estimated cost of casualties plus property damage. The FAA has revised two components of its MPL methodology since our 2012 report. However, the agency has not yet updated the cost of a casualty, leaving a previously identified weakness unaddressed. The FAA has taken steps designed to improve two of three elements of its MPL methodology, including revising its methodology for estimating the number of potential casualties for a given launch and changing the factor it uses to estimate losses from property damage in the MPL calculation from 50 percent to 25 percent. The FAA has not updated the cost-of-casualty amount, leaving a previously identified weakness unaddressed. The FAA has not developed guidance for determining which methodological tools should be used for a given launch, but is in the process of developing internal guidance on how to determine which methodological tools should be used for future launches. The FAA has also begun improving other aspects of its MPL process, but important actions remain incomplete. The FAA Administrator should fulfill the CSLCA mandate to include ensuring a balance of risk between the federal government and launch companies as part of FAA’s MPL methodology evaluation by reexamining the current probability thresholds. The FAA Administrator should fulfill the CSLCA mandate to analyze the cost impact of implementing its revised MPL methodology by evaluating the impact on the direct costs of launch companies and the federal government. The FAA Administrator should fulfill the\n"

      "Prediction: The Coast Guard operates a fleet of over 1,400 boats and ships and 201 fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, with a staff of over 47,000 members. The agency is responsible for 11 statutory missions, including marine safety, search and rescue, and environmental protection. The Coast Guard has developed goals and targets to assess and communicate agency performance, but some of these targets are derived from external factors. The Coast Guard is also modernizing its assets used to carry out various missions, but concerns surrounding the affordability of this effort remain. The report recommends that the Coast Guard improve the completeness of mission data, use more realistic asset performance data, improve performance goal data, improve transparency of data on mission performance, and improve capital planning transparency. The Coast Guard has concurred with these recommendations and is taking steps to address them. The report also notes that the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report has not been publicly released since 2011, which limits visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. The report recommends that future Coast Guard APRs be available on the Coast Guard's public website. Overall, the report highlights the importance of effective program management and data-driven decision-making for the Coast Guard to achieve its missions and meet its goals.\n"

      "Prediction: The Small Business Act was passed in 1953 to promote the interests of small businesses and ensure that they receive a fair proportion of federal contracts and subcontracts. The act specifies that one of the ways to preserve free competitive enterprise is to insure that small businesses receive a \"fair proportion\" of federal contracts and subcontracts. The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several types of programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in federal contracting; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. The SBA's industry-specific size standards are used to determine eligibility for federal small business contracting purposes. The SBA's size standards are designed to encourage competition within each industry and ensure that SBA assistance is provided only to firms that are not dominant in their field on a national basis. The SBA's Office of Government Contracting Area Office (Area Office) serves the area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located and initially reviews the protest. The SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) accepts appeals of the Area Office's decision. The SBA's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) is located in each federal agency and is responsible for ensuring that small businesses, SDBs, WOSBs, SDVOSBs, and HUBZone small businesses are treated fairly and have an opportunity to compete and be selected for a fair amount of the agency's contract dollars. The SBA's commercial market representatives help prime contractors find small businesses that are capable of performing subcontracts; provide counseling on the contractor's responsibility to maximize subcontracting opportunities for small businesses; and conduct periodic reviews of contractors awarded contracts requiring an acceptable subcontracting plan. The Small Business Procurement Advisory Council (SBPAC) has statutory duties to develop positions on proposed procurement regulations affecting the small business community, submit comments reflecting such positions to appropriate regulatory authorities, conduct reviews of each OSDBU to determine the office's compliance with its statutory requirements, identify best practices for maximizing small business utilization in federal contracting, and submit annually a report describing the comments submitted to appropriate regulatory authorities, the results of its review of each OSDBU, and best practices identified for maximizing small business contracting. The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 generally requires \"full and open competition\" for government procurement contracts\n"

      "Prediction: The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 was created to promote outdoor recreation and strengthen the health and vitality of U.S. citizens. The fund receives $900 million in revenues annually, but only if appropriated by Congress through the discretionary appropriations process. The LWCF Act outlines uses of the fund for federal and state purposes, with not less than 40% of the total made available to the fund being used for \"federal purposes\" and not less than 40% for \"financial assistance to states.\" The act lists the federal purposes for which the President is to allot LWCF funds \"unless otherwise allotted in the appropriation Act making them available.\" These purposes primarily relate to the acquisition of lands and waters (and interests therein) by the federal government. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the history of the LWCF, appropriations acts have provided funding for three general purposes. First, for each year since FY1965, appropriations for land acquisition have been provided to some or all of the major federal land management agencies—the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), and Forest Service (FS). Second, for nearly every year since FY1965, appropriations have funded the outdoor recreation matching grant program, to assist states in recreational planning, acquiring recreational lands and waters, and developing outdoor recreational facilities. Third, beginning in FY1998, appropriations from the LWCF have been provided each year, except FY1999, to fund other federal programs with related natural resource purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The $18.9 billion appropriated from the LWCF through FY2019 has been allocated in different proportions among federal land acquisition, the state grant program, and other purposes. The largest portion of the total—$11.4 billion—has been appropriated for federal land acquisition. The state grant program has received the second-largest portion, $4.8 billion. Other purposes have received the remaining $2.7 billion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Congress continues to consider the extent to which the LWCF should fund purposes other than federal land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states. Some traditional LWCF advocates and beneficiaries have expressed concern about expanding the use of the funds, particularly if such expansion results in lower appropriations for land acquisition and outdoor recreation grants to states. Some Members of Congress, Presidents, and stakeholders have supported funding other purposes in order to draw on the balance in the fund for policy priorities, to shift the focus of the fund from land acquisition, or to achieve other goals. \n",

      "Prediction: The Navy has experienced four significant mishaps at sea since January 2017, resulting in serious damage to ships and the loss of 17 sailors. Three of these mishaps involved ships homeported overseas in Yokosuka, Japan. The Navy has reduced its number of ships by 17 percent since 1998, but the number of ships deployed overseas has remained roughly constant at about 100 ships. This has resulted in each ship being deployed more to maintain the same level of presence. The Navy has had to shorten, eliminate, or defer training and maintenance periods to support these high deployment rates. The Navy has also had to reduce training and maintenance periods for ships homeported overseas to maximize their operational availability. This has resulted in difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained. The Navy's Surface Force Readiness Manual states that the high operational tempo and frequent tasking of ships homeported overseas requires that these ships always be prepared to execute complex operations and notes that this demand for continuous readiness also means that ships homeported overseas should maintain maximum training, material condition, and manning readiness. The Navy's projected end strength and fleet size show that it will likely face manning challenges as it seeks to increase the size of its fleet by as much as 30 percent over its current size. The Navy's guidance does not require that the factors it uses to calculate manpower requirements be reassessed periodically or when conditions change, to ensure that these factors remain valid and that crews are appropriately sized. The Navy's implementation of the optimized fleet response plan—and readiness recovery more broadly—is premised on adherence to deployment, training, and maintenance schedules. However, the Navy has faced significant challenges, such as delays in completing maintenance and emerging demands, in achieving its readiness recovery goals for carrier strike groups and amphibious ready groups. The Navy has plans to grow its fleet by as much as 30 percent, but it has not yet shown the ability to adequately man, maintain, and operate the current fleet. These readiness problems need to be addressed and will require the Navy to implement recommendations, particularly in the areas of assessing the risks associated with overseas basing, reassessing sailor workload and the factors used to size ship crews, managing investments in its shipyards, and applying sound planning and sustained management attention to its readiness rebuilding efforts. Continued congressional oversight will be needed to ensure that the Navy demonstrates progress in addressing its maintenance, training, and other challenges.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the concept of the digital economy and how it relates to international tax policy. It highlights the challenges faced by multinational corporations (MNCs) in the digital economy, such as avoiding permanent establishments in higher-tax jurisdictions and using transfer pricing to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. The report also examines the various digital services taxes (DSTs) proposed by different countries, including the European Commission, Spain, the UK, and France. The report argues that DSTs are not structured as taxes on corporate profits, but rather as excise taxes on specific types of activities. It also analyzes the economic effects of DSTs, including how they distort markets by reducing the financial return to capital in digital economy industries or by raising the cost of goods and services intermediated through digital platforms. The report concludes by discussing the administrative challenges of DSTs, including the need for lawmakers to clarify what types of activities are subject to tax and which parties bear the statutory burden of paying tax. It also notes that DSTs create unequal economic treatment between similarly situated firms inside and outside of the digital economy, and that they could be regressive in terms of vertical equity. Overall, the report suggests that DSTs are not a viable solution to the challenges faced by MNCs in the digital economy, and that alternative policy tools, such as the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax, may be more effective in addressing these challenges.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the legal framework for analyzing the constitutionality of commercial disclosure requirements under the First Amendment. It explains that while commercial speech generally receives less protection under the First Amendment than other types of speech, the government's ability to regulate commercial speech has been linked to its authority to regulate commercial transactions. The report also discusses the possible legal frameworks for analyzing the constitutionality of commercial disclosure requirements, including strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and Zauderer review. The report notes that the Supreme Court has recently suggested that content neutrality principles may be relevant in the commercial sphere, which could lead to heightened scrutiny of content-based commercial disclosure requirements. The report concludes by emphasizing that commercial disclosure requirements should be scrutinized in light of the speakers they cover and the burdens they pose, and that evidence should be developed to support the need for the regulation. Overall, the report highlights the importance of considering the First Amendment implications of commercial disclosure requirements and the need for careful analysis and evidence-based decision-making in this area.\n"

      "Prediction: The United States has been committed to building Afghanistan's security and governance since 2001 to prevent the country from becoming a sanctuary for terrorists. The US currently has two missions in Afghanistan: a counterterrorism mission led by the US and the NATO-led Resolute Support train, advise, and assist mission, which the US participates in with other coalition nations. The objective of Resolute Support is to establish self-sustaining Afghan security ministries and forces that work together to maintain security in Afghanistan. The US contributes more troops to Resolute Support than any other coalition nation, with about 8,500 assigned to Resolute Support to train, advise, and assist the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). The US also provides financial support for manning, training, and equipping the ANDSF through the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. The report highlights that the ANDSF have improved in some capability areas since Resolute Support began, but they continue to face critical capability gaps, impeding their ability to maintain security and stability in Afghanistan independent of US and coalition forces. DOD lacks reliable information about the degree to which conventional forces, which make up about three-quarters of the ANDSF, are able to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. The report recommends that the Secretary of Defense develop and implement options for collecting reliable information on the ANDSF conventional forces' ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. The report also provides information on the Afghan Air Force's ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters, Mobile Strike Force Vehicles (MSFV), and radios. The report concludes that without reliable information on the equipment operation and maintenance abilities of ANDSF conventional forces, DOD may be unable to fully evaluate the success of its train, advise, assist, and equip efforts in Afghanistan.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the extent to which implementing partners of the Department of State (State) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) experience banking access challenges that affect their implementation of humanitarian assistance projects. The report also examines USAID implementing partners’ reporting on banking access challenges and actions relevant U.S. agencies have taken to help address banking access challenges encountered by nonprofit organizations (NPO). The report finds that the majority of implementing partners—many of which are charitable organizations—of U.S. government assistance that were interviewed had experienced some banking access challenges. Despite these findings and others’ findings on the prevalence of banking access challenges facing humanitarian assistance organizations, USAID’s current partner reporting does not capture information related to the potential risks of banking access challenges faced by its partners. Without collecting this information, USAID cannot help the partners mitigate banking access challenges. Additionally, if these challenges are not documented and shared throughout the agency, the prevalence of the challenges and potential risks cannot be fully assessed. The report recommends that the Administrator of USAID should take steps to collect information on banking access challenges experienced by USAID’s implementing partners and communicate information on banking access challenges faced by partners both within USAID and with external entities, such as other U.S. agencies and U.S. implementing partners. The report also notes that the United States provides humanitarian assistance in countries that are often plagued by conflict, instability, or other issues that increase the risk of financial crimes. Some of these countries also face U.S. sanctions that are aimed at their governments or other actors that engage in terrorism or illicit activities. Additionally, to ensure that the U.S. financial system is not used for money laundering or financing terrorism, financial institutions such as banks are subject to various U.S. laws and regulations that require banks to conduct proper due diligence on entities, such as those transferring funds to high-risk countries. However, there is concern among some organizations that banks’ higher level of due diligence, especially for clients such as charitable organizations that provide humanitarian assistance in high-risk countries, may create undue difficulties, including delays, for these organizations. The report notes that Treasury, as a lead agency in fighting financial crimes and as an issuer of regulations that have a significant effect on charities’ access to the banking system, has conducted meetings between charities, banks, and government officials to discuss banking access challenges and released guidance on sanctions and other related issues. State, as a provider of funding for humanitarian assistance, has issued guidance to its overseas posts on banking access challenges. In addition, both State and Treasury are involved\n"

      "Prediction: The Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) provides support to military families with special needs at their current and proposed locations. The program has three components: identification and enrollment, assignment coordination, and family support. The report highlights the challenges faced by the EFMP in providing consistent family support services across the four military services. The report also notes that DOD has not developed a standard for determining the sufficiency of funding and resources each Service allocates for family support. The report recommends that DOD assess the extent to which each Service is providing sufficient resources for an appropriate number of family support providers and developing services plans for each family with special needs. The report also recommends that DOD develop common performance metrics for assignment coordination and family support and implement a systematic process for evaluating the results of monitoring activities conducted by each Service's EFMP. The report notes that the EFMP is challenging to implement due to the size, complexity, and mission of the U.S. military. The report concludes that by providing little direction on how the Services should provide family support or what the scope of family support services should be, some servicemembers get more or less from the EFMP each time they relocate, including when a servicemember from one Service is assigned to a joint base led by another Service. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of evaluating and developing program improvements based on the results of the Services' monitoring to ensure the Services' EFMPs achieve the desired outcomes and improve its ability to assess the overall effectiveness of the program.\n"

      "Prediction: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large deployable space telescope designed for infrared observations and is the scientific successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope. The JWST project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. The observatory segment includes several elements and major subsystems, such as the Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft, and is being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts. The JWST project is relying on two contractors: Northrop Grumman and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy’s Space Telescope Science Institute. Northrop Grumman plays the largest role, developing the sunshield, the Optical Telescope Element, the spacecraft, and the Mid-Infrared Instrument’s cryocooler, in addition to integrating and testing the observatory. The JWST project has a history of significant schedule delays and increases to project costs, which resulted in replans in 2011 and 2018. The project has yet to complete three of five integration and test phases, and the project has many risks to mitigate, technical challenges to overcome, and challenging test events to complete, which could affect the project’s schedule and risk posture. Conducting a Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level (JCL) analysis prior to the system integration review would provide NASA and Congress with critical information for making informed resource decisions on the JWST project and its affordability within NASA’s portfolio of projects more broadly. NASA has taken steps to augment oversight of the contractor and project following the discovery of the embedded design flaws and workmanship errors that contributed to the project’s most recent schedule delays and cost increases. The JWST oversight structure includes a number of positions that could be responsible for ensuring that the recent augmentations to contractor and project oversight are sustained through launch. The project manager has sole responsibility for ensuring that these improvements are sustained through launch. The project has had recurring issues with effective internal and external communication as well as defining key management and oversight responsibilities, both of which are important to sustaining oversight. The project may encounter new schedule pressures as it proceeds through integration and test. Conducting a JCL would better inform decision makers on the status of the project as they determine whether the project can complete remaining project development with acceptable risk and within its cost and schedule constraints. Given the project is now on its third iteration of cost and schedule commitments, conducting a JCL is a small step that NASA can take to demonstrate it is on track\n"

      "Prediction: The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) is a defined benefit multiemployer pension plan that provides pension benefits to International Brotherhood of Teamsters union members in the trucking industry. CSPF is one of the largest multiemployer plans and has been the subject of investigations by the IRS, DOL, and DOJ. The DOL investigation resulted in the establishment of a federal court-enforceable consent decree in 1982 that remains in force today. CSPF's critical financial condition is attributed to a combination of factors, including investment losses, insufficient employer contributions, trends within the national trucking industry and its workforce, funding challenges and common investment practices of multiemployer plans, and the impact of market downturns on long-term investment performance. The consent decree placed exclusive responsibility for controlling and managing the plan's assets with an independent asset manager, called a named fiduciary. The named fiduciaries set and executed the plan's investment objectives using similar investment philosophies, but differing investment return goals and target asset allocations. CSPF's investment policy was broad and consistently directed that asset allocations be weighted towards equities. The plan's asset allocation changed significantly during the middle period, with the plan's allocation to equities increasing from 37 percent at the end of 1993 to 69 percent at the end of 2002. CSPF's deteriorating financial condition precipitated a recent investment policy change that will move plan assets into fixed income and cash equivalent investments ahead of projected insolvency. CSPF officials said these asset allocation changes are intended to provide participants greater certainty regarding their benefits and reduce the plan's exposure to market risk and volatility until it is projected to become insolvent on January 1, 2025. CSPF's investment returns and fees are generally in line with similar pension plans or other large institutional investors of similar size. CSPF's investment fees and administrative expenses were in line with other large multiemployer plans. CSPF's administrative expenses were among the lowest 5 percent of this group of large multiemployer plans. CSPF's annual administrative expenses as a percentage of benefits were below the median of our peer group of large plans in all years we reviewed. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 made changes to the multiemployer system that were intended to improve its financial condition. Key changes included creation of critical and declining status, permitted reduction of accrued benefits, increased PBGC premiums, and creation of a new framework of rules for partition. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was intended to improve the funding\n"

      "Prediction: The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 provided funding for veterans to receive healthcare services from community providers through the Choice Program. The temporary authority and funding for the Choice Program ended on June 6, 2019. The report discusses the challenges faced by veterans in accessing care at VA medical facilities, including long wait times and lengthy travel distances. The report also discusses the role of third-party administrators (TPAs) in managing networks of community providers, scheduling appointments, and paying community providers for their services. The report highlights three key factors affecting the timeliness of claim payments to community providers under the Choice Program: VA's untimely payments of TPA invoices, Choice Program contractual requirements related to provider reimbursement, and inadequate provider education on filing Choice Program claims. The report recommends that VA monitor data on SAR approval decision time frames to ensure VA medical facilities are adhering to VA policy and take corrective actions as necessary. The report also recommends that VA collect data and monitor compliance with the Choice Program contractual requirements pertaining to customer service for community providers and take corrective actions as necessary. VA has concurred with these recommendations and is taking steps to address them.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the capital planning process of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and its progress towards its track preventive maintenance goals. The report finds that WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures for its new capital planning process, which includes methodologies for ranking and selecting capital projects for funding in the fiscal year 2020 capital budget and fiscal years 2020-2025 Capital Improvement Program. The report also recommends that WMATA develop performance measures to assess capital investments and the capital planning process, obtain complete information regarding WMATA's asset inventory and physical condition assessments, conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of the track preventive maintenance program, and prepare a formal program management plan for the track preventive maintenance program. The report notes that WMATA's new capital planning process could address some of the weaknesses it identified in the previous process, such as better distinguishing capital needs from capital projects. However, WMATA has not established documented policies and procedures to guide the developed performance measures to assess capital projects and the capital planning process, or developed a plan to obtain complete information on its assets and their physical condition. The report also notes that WMATA's track preventive maintenance program has made progress towards its goals of reducing track defects and fire incidents, but still faces challenges in implementing the program. The report recommends that WMATA conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of the track preventive maintenance program that includes both quantitative and qualitative assessment of relevant program risks, and prepare a formal program management plan for the track preventive maintenance program that aligns with WMATA's strategic plan, addresses how the program is linked to overall strategic goals and objectives, and includes program milestones and decision points. Overall, the report suggests that WMATA needs to improve its capital planning process and track preventive maintenance program to better ensure investments are directed to WMATA's highest priority needs and that capital investments meet their intended outcomes and that the capital planning process helps WMATA achieve its strategic goals and objectives.\n"

      "Prediction: The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that aims to eliminate trade barriers and create nondiscriminatory rules to govern trade. The United States was a major force behind the establishment of the WTO in 1995 and the rules and agreements that resulted from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The WTO encompasses and expands on the commitments and institutional functions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was established in 1947 by the United States and 22 other nations. The evolution of U.S. leadership in the WTO and the institution's future agenda have been of interest to Congress. The terms set by the WTO agreements govern the majority of U.S. trading relationships. Some 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries that do not have free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States, including China, the European Union (EU), India, and Japan, and thus rely on the terms of WTO agreements. Congress has recognized the WTO as the \"foundation of the global trading system\" within U.S. trade legislation and plays a direct legislative and oversight role over WTO agreements. U.S. FTAs also build on core WTO agreements. While the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) represents the United States at the WTO, Congress holds constitutional authority over foreign commerce and establishes U.S. trade negotiating objectives and principles and implements U.S. trade agreements through legislation. U.S. priorities and objectives for the GATT/WTO are reflected in trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation since 1974. Congress also has oversight of the USTR and other executive branch agencies that participate in WTO meetings and enforce WTO commitments. The WTO's effectiveness as a negotiating body for broad-based trade liberalization has come under intensified scrutiny, as has its role in resolving trade disputes. The WTO has often struggled to reach consensus over issues that can place developed against developing country members (such as agricultural subsidies, industrial goods tariffs, and intellectual property rights protection). It has also struggled to address newer trade barriers, such as digital trade restrictions and the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in international commerce, which have become more prominent in the years since the WTO was established. Global supply chains and advances in technology have transformed global commerce, but trade rules have failed to keep up with the pace of change; since 1995 WTO members have been unable to reach consensus for a new comprehensive multilateral agreement. As a result, many countries have turned to negotiating FTAs with one another outside the\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the steps that executive branch agencies are required to take regarding improper payments under the Improper Payments Information and Accountability Act (IPIA), as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) and Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act (IPERIA), and related OMB guidance. The steps include reviewing all programs and activities to identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, developing improper payment estimates for those programs and activities, analyzing the root causes of improper payments and developing corrective actions to reduce them, and reporting on the results of addressing these requirements. The report also discusses the major components of developing an improper payment estimate, including selecting a sample of program payments and reviewing them to determine whether the relevant payments were proper. The report highlights that agencies must apply \"improper payment\" in the context of their programs when developing improper payment estimates. The report also discusses the testing processes used by agencies to estimate improper payments, which varied among the 10 programs reviewed. The report recommends that the Director of OMB develop guidance on how agencies test to identify improper payments, such as using a risk-based approach to help ensure that key risks of improper payments, such as eligibility, are addressed through testing processes. The report also recommends that the Director of OMB develop guidance clarifying the appropriate treatment of nonresponse cases during improper payment testing. The report also recommends that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) assess the processes for estimating Military Pay improper payments to determine whether they effectively address key risks of improper payments, including eligibility for different types of pay and allowances, and take steps to update the processes to incorporate key risks that are not currently addressed. The report also recommends that the Director of OPM assess the processes to estimate Retirement improper payments to determine whether they effectively address key risks of improper payments, including eligibility and whether older claims face different risks of improper payments than new claims, and take steps to update the processes to incorporate key risks that are not currently addressed. Finally, the report recommends that the Commissioner of IRS update IRS's improper payment estimation methodology to not exclude recovered overpayments from its EITC improper payment estimate. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of estimation of improper payments in understanding the extent of the problem and developing effective corrective actions to address it.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the reliability of Transition Assistance Program (TAP) data on participation levels and the factors that affect Coast Guard servicemembers' participation. The report also evaluates the extent to which the Coast Guard measures TAP performance and monitors key areas of TAP implementation. The report found that the Coast Guard lacks policies and procedures governing reliable data collection, including when data should be entered and by whom, which makes it difficult to determine the extent to which its servicemembers attend TAP. The report recommends that the Coast Guard establish a formal performance goal with a measurable target for participation rates in VOW Act-mandated portions of TAP, monitor the extent to which Coast Guard servicemembers participate in TAP within prescribed time frames, monitor the extent to which Coast Guard servicemembers who elect to participate in additional 2-day classes are afforded the opportunity to attend, issue an updated Commandant Instruction that defines the roles and responsibilities of the personnel who administer the program and ensure servicemembers' participation, and share TAP information with DOD and other interagency partners. The report also recommends that the Coast Guard enable unit commanders and the higher-level commanders to access TAP performance information specifically for the units they oversee so that they can monitor compliance with all TAP requirements. Finally, the report recommends that the Coast Guard share TAP information with DOD and other interagency partners, such as data on participation in required TAP courses and additional 2-day classes. The report concludes that improving the reliability of the Coast Guard's TAP data will be essential for the benefits of data sharing to be realized.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the effects of radiation exposure on human health, particularly low-dose radiation. The report notes that the higher the radiation dose, the sooner the effects of radiation will appear, and the higher the probability of death. However, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect, and there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects for non-U.S. populations can be extrapolated to a U.S. population that is regularly exposed to low-dose radiation. The report also notes that federal agencies have generally taken the advice of scientific advisory bodies in developing and applying radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public. The report recommends that the Secretary of Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation. The report notes that collaborative mechanisms can serve multiple purposes, such as leading interagency efforts to develop and coordinate sound science and technology policies across the federal government. The report also notes that the seven agencies that funded research on health effects of low-dose radiation for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 collaborated on particular research projects through various mechanisms, including joint funding of individual projects, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to address overall research priorities. The report concludes by stating that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in developing the most appropriate mechanism.\n"

      "Prediction: The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was enacted to ensure that federally insured banking institutions serve the credit needs of their local areas. The CRA requires federal banking regulators to conduct examinations to assess whether banks are meeting local credit needs, and they issue CRA credits for qualifying activities such as mortgage, consumer, and business lending; community investments; and low-cost services that benefit low- and moderate-income areas and entities. The CRA applies to banking institutions with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, but not to credit unions, insurance companies, or other nonbank institutions. The report analyzes the difficulty in attributing bank lending decisions to CRA incentives, as the CRA does not specify the quality and quantity of CRA-qualifying activities, making it difficult to link the composition of banks' loan portfolios to either too strong or too weak CRA enforcement. The report also discusses recent policy discussions regarding modernization of the CRA, including revisiting the approach for determining banks' assessment areas, establishing clearer standards for CRA-qualifying activities, and incorporating performance incentives that might result in more efficient lending activities. The report concludes that it can be difficult to determine the extent to which banks' financial decisions are motivated by CRA incentives, profit incentives, or both.\n"

However, the report found that VA does not have a reliable system for collecting and analyzing misconduct data department-wide, and that there are gaps in documentation and adherence to policy when adjudicating cases of employee misconduct. The report also found that VA does not consistently adhere to VA's policy for documenting that procedures were followed in the adjudication of misconduct cases, and that there is a lack of oversight to HR policies, which increases the risk that employees will not be adequately informed of their rights during the adjudication process. Additionally, the report found that VA does not have internal controls to ensure adherence to proper separation-of-duty standards involving the removal of an employee, and that there is an increased risk that substantiated misconduct will go unaddressed if there is no recommendation for corrective action. The report recommends that VA develop and implement guidance to collect complete and reliable misconduct and associated disciplinary-action data department-wide, and that VA ensure that program and facility human-resources personnel adhere to policy governing documentation contained within evidence files to support conclusions reached. The report also recommends that VA implement internal controls to ensure that proper adherence to separation-of-duty standards involving the removal of an employee are consistent with policy, and that VA take steps to ensure independence of referred allegations of misconduct by requiring that investigations be conducted outside the control of the facility or program office involved in the misconduct. Finally, the report recommends that VA ensure that employees who report wrongdoing are treated fairly and protected against retaliation.\n"

The FCC's mission is to ensure that all Americans have access to a rapid, efficient, nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges. The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. The day-to-day functions of the FCC are carried out by seven bureaus and ten offices. The bureaus process applications for licenses and other filings, analyze complaints, conduct investigations, develop and implement regulatory programs, and participate in hearings, among other things.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the various powers available to the President of the United States in times of crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstances. These powers are not limited to military or war situations and can be derived from the Constitution or statutory law. The report also highlights the importance of statutory grants of power for emergency conditions, which are continuously maintained or permanently available for the President's ready use in responding to an emergency. The report notes that the exercise of emergency powers has been somewhat dependent upon the Chief Executive's view of the presidential office. The report also discusses the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which established formal procedures for invoking emergency authorities, accounting for their use, and regulating their activation and application. The report concludes by noting that the development, exercise, and regulation of emergency powers have come to be increasingly rooted in statutory law, and the range of this authority has come to be more circumscribed, and the options for its use have come to be regulated procedurally through the National Emergencies Act. The report suggests that further improvements and reforms in this policy area might be pursued and perfected.\n"

USPS has seen a significant increase in the volume of its competitive products, from 750 million pieces in fiscal year 2008 to 4.9 billion pieces in fiscal year 2017. Revenue from these products has also increased from about 10 percent of all USPS mail revenues in fiscal year 2008 to about 28 percent in fiscal year 2017. USPS officials have stated that they leverage information gained from scanning to provide customers with real-time visibility for the location of a competitive product in USPS's delivery process as well as accurate estimates of the delivery time of USPS's competitive products. However, despite USPS's high scanning rate, some missed and inaccurate scans for competitive products do occur. The report recommends that USPS identify and adopt a set of internal control standards that can be used as the basis for operational internal-control activities, such as those for scanning competitive products. USPS should also improve the communication of standard operating procedures for scanning competitive products by updating or consolidating USPS documents, job aids, and standard work steps. Finally, USPS should create standard operating procedures for managers on how to address inaccurate scans and use available reports to investigate and resolve scanning issues. USPS has committed to completing corrective actions by November of 2018.\n"

      "Prediction: NASA's mission is to drive advances in science, technology, aeronautics, and space exploration, and contribute to education, innovation, our country's economic vitality, and the stewardship of the Earth. To accomplish this mission, NASA establishes programs and projects that rely on complex instruments and spacecraft. NASA's portfolio of major projects ranges from space satellites equipped with advanced sensors to study the Earth to a telescope intended to explore the universe to spacecraft to transport humans and cargo to and beyond low-Earth orbit. Some of NASA's projects are expected to incorporate new and sophisticated technologies that must operate in harsh, distant environments. The life cycle for NASA space flight projects consists of two phases— formulation, which takes a project from concept to preliminary design, and implementation, which includes building, launching, and operating the system, among other activities. NASA further divides formulation and implementation into phase A through phase F. Major projects must get approval from senior NASA officials at key decision points before they can enter each new phase. NASA's current portfolio of major space telescopes includes three projects—WFIRST, TESS, and JWST—that vary in cost, complexity, and phase of the acquisition life cycle. WFIRST, a project that entered the concept and technology development phase and established preliminary cost and schedule estimates in February 2016, is in the earliest stages of the acquisition life cycle. With preliminary cost estimates ranging from $3.2 billion to $3.8 billion, this project is an observatory designed to perform wide-field imaging and survey of the sky at near-infrared wavelengths to answer questions about the structure and evolution of the universe and to expand our knowledge of planets beyond our solar system. The current design includes a 2.4 meter telescope that was built and qualified for another federal agency over 10 years ago; the project is evaluating which components to reuse and which to modify, refurbish, or build new. TESS—a smaller project whose latest cost estimate is approximately $337 million—is targeted to launch in March 2018 and will be used to conduct the first extensive survey of the sky from space for transiting exoplanets. And finally, JWST, with a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion, is one of NASA's most complex projects and top priorities. The telescope is designed to help understand the origin and destiny of the universe, the creation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies, and the formation of stars and planetary systems. With a 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST is expected to operate at about\n"

      "Prediction: The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to enhance small business access to capital; contracting programs to increase small business opportunities in securing federal contracts; direct loan programs for businesses, homeowners, and renters to assist their recovery from natural disasters; and small business management and technical assistance training programs to assist business formation and expansion. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program has been operational since April 1971 and is designed to increase small business' access to federal, state, and local government contracting, as well as private-sector contracting, by guaranteeing bid, performance, payment, and specified ancillary bonds. The program guarantees individual contracts of up to $6.5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The SBA's guarantee currently ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss if a default occurs. In FY2018, the SBA guaranteed 10,800 bid and final surety bonds with a total contract value of nearly $6.5 billion. Although the surety industry does not report the total value of the bonds it issues each year, estimates suggest that the SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program represents a relatively small percentage of the market for surety bonds. The report examines the program's legislative origin and historical development, including the decision to supplement the original Prior Approval Program with a Preferred Surety Bond Guarantee Program (PSB program) that initially provided SBA-approved sureties a lower guarantee rate in exchange for allowing preferred sureties to issue SBA-guaranteed bonds to small businesses without the SBA's prior approval. The report also examines the program's current eligibility standards and requirements, and provides performance statistics, including the number and amount of bond guarantees issued annually. The report notes that the SBA has periodically increased the program's fees charged to applicants and sureties, but historically, the SBA has tried to keep the program's fees as low as economically feasible and the guarantee percentage as high as economically feasible to encourage the program's use. The report also notes that the number and amount of final surety bonds guaranteed by the SBA has generally increased in recent years due to generally improving economic conditions and legislation that temporarily and then permanently raised the program's maximum individual contract amount from $2 million to $5 million, and up to $10 million if a federal contracting officer certifies that such a guarantee is necessary. The report notes that there was relatively little\n"

      "Prediction: The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires lobbyists to register with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House and to file quarterly reports disclosing their respective lobbying activities. Lobbyists are required to file their registrations and reports electronically with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House through a single entry point. The LDA defines a lobbyist as an individual who is employed or retained by a client for compensation, who has made more than one lobbying contact (written or oral communication to covered officials, such as a high ranking agency official or a Member of Congress made on behalf of a client), and whose lobbying activities represent at least 20 percent of the time that he or she spends on behalf of the client during the quarter. Lobbying firms are persons or entities that have one or more employees who lobby on behalf of a client other than that person or entity. The LDA also requires lobbyists to report certain political contributions semiannually in the LD-203 report. The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House, along with USAO, are responsible for ensuring LDA compliance. The LDA requires lobbyists to disclose lobbying contacts made with federal agencies on behalf of the client for the reporting period. The LDA requires lobbyists to disclose previously held covered positions in the executive or legislative branch, such as high ranking agency officials and congressional staff, when first registering as a lobbyist for a new client. The report found that most lobbyists reporting $5,000 or more in income or expenses provided written documentation to varying degrees for the reporting elements in their disclosure reports. However, in recent years our findings showed some variation in the estimated percentage of lobbyists who have reports with documentation for income and expense supporting lobbying activities. The report also found that rounding difficulties have been a recurring issue on LD-2 reports from 2010 through 2017. The report also found that lobbyists for most LD-2 reports provided documentation for selected elements of their LD-2 reports from 2010 through 2017. The report also found that lobbyists for an estimated 93 percent of LD-2 reports filed year-end 2016 for all lobbyists listed political contributions on the report as required. The report also found that lobbyists amended 15 of the 98 LD-2 disclosure reports in our original sample to change previously reported information after we contacted them. The report also found that lobbyists failed to disclose one or more reportable contributions on 12 percent of reports. The report also found that most lobbying firms filed contribution reports as required in our sample from 2010 through\n"

      "Prediction: The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides various programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty and venture capital programs, contracting programs, direct loan programs, and small business management and technical assistance training programs. The report examines appropriations for the SBA over time, focusing on developments and trends since FY2000. The report also provides total available funding and actual and anticipated expenditures for the SBA's entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. The report shows that SBA appropriations have varied significantly from year to year since FY2000 and across all three major SBA spending categories. The variation in appropriations for disaster assistance is largely due to supplemental appropriations provided to address disaster needs arising from the impact of major hurricanes. Business loan credit subsidies represent the net present value of cash flows to and from the SBA over the life of the agency's loan portfolios. The variation in appropriations for SBA business loan credit subsidies since FY2000 is primarily due to the impact of changing economic conditions on the SBA's guaranteed loan portfolios. The report also examines appropriations and total available funding for the SBA's other programs spending category, including salaries and expenses, business loan administration, the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Advocacy, and entrepreneurial development noncredit programs. The report shows that the SBA's entrepreneurial development noncredit programs provide a variety of management and training services to small businesses, and Congress provides appropriations for eight management and technical assistance training programs. The report also shows that the SBA's recommended appropriations for some programs have not kept pace with inflation, while others have exceeded the rate of inflation. The report concludes by discussing the SBA's Entrepreneurship Education initiative and Growth Accelerator initiative, which provide targeted advice and resources to help entrepreneurs start and scale their businesses.\n"

      "Prediction: The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund provides cash assistance and medical benefits to miners with black lung disease. The maximum cash assistance payments range from $650 to $1,300 per month, depending on the number of dependents the miner has. Miners receiving cash assistance are also eligible for medical benefits that cover the treatment of their black-lung-related conditions. The average annual cost for medical treatment in fiscal year 2017 was approximately $6,980 per miner. There were about 25,700 total beneficiaries (primary and dependents) receiving black lung benefits during fiscal year 2017. The decrease in the number of beneficiaries over time has resulted from a combination of declining coal mining employment and an aging beneficiary population. Black lung claims are processed by DOL’s Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs. Contested claims are adjudicated by DOL’s Office of Administrative Law Judges, which issues decisions that can be appealed to the Benefits Review Board. Claimants and mine operators may further appeal these agency decisions to the federal courts. If an award is contested, claimants can receive interim benefits, which are generally paid from the Trust Fund according to DOL officials, while their claims are in the appeals process. Final awards are either funded by mine operators—who are identified as the responsible employers of claimants—or the Trust Fund, when responsible employers cannot be identified or do not pay. In fiscal year 2017, black lung claims had an approval rate of about 29 percent, according to DOL data. Of the 19,430 primary black lung beneficiaries receiving benefits during fiscal year 2017, 64 percent (12,464) were paid from the Trust Fund, 25 percent (4,798) were paid by liable mine operators, and 11 percent (2,168) were receiving interim benefits, according to DOL officials. Black Lung Disability Trust Fund revenue is primarily obtained from mine operators through the coal tax. The coal tax is imposed at two rates, depending on whether the coal is extracted from underground or surface mines. The current tax rates are $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales price. Therefore, if a ton of underground-mined coal is sold for less than $25, than the tax paid would be less than $1.10. For instance, if a ton of underground-mined coal sold for $20, than it would be taxed at 4.4 percent of the sales price,\n"

The report found that federal agencies do not have systematic processes for assessing the continued need for personal property, which may lead to idle property that could be put to better use elsewhere within the agency or the federal government. The report also found that agencies may be retaining property that is no longer needed. The report recommends that the Director of OMB provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies’ policies or processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property.

      "Prediction: The U.S. government engages with the governments of other countries in the Western Hemisphere through various inter-American organizations, including the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH. These organizations are effective implementing partners for projects serving U.S. national interests and priorities throughout the hemisphere. Member states collectively finance these organizations by providing assessed and voluntary contributions. The U.S. government provides voluntary contributions to the OAS, PAHO, and IICA primarily through assistance agreements for specific projects from State, USAID, HHS, and USDA. The Institute of Internal Auditors provides the framework for international organizations to oversee funds such as the assessed contributions provided by member states to OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH. The four organizations follow the internal control standards of the IIA, codified in the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, according to PAIGH officials and OAS, PAHO, and IICA documents. All four organizations have internal and external auditors, as required by these standards. The four organizations have oversight mechanisms, as shown in table 3. The four organizations follow the internal control standards of the IIA, codified in the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, according to PAIGH officials and OAS, PAHO, and IICA documents. All four organizations have internal and external auditors, as required by these standards. Furthermore, OAS, PAHO, and IICA have additional oversight mechanisms, such as anti-fraud policies and program evaluation processes. The officials we interviewed from State, USAID, HHS, and USDA expressed confidence in the four organizations’ management of their assessed and voluntary contributions. All four organizations document the status of their financial and internal control activities in audit reports posted on their public websites. For example, the OAS Office of the Inspector General’s April 2017 Annual Report included an update on its five ongoing audits and investigations. The report also outlined progress made against prior recommendations. U.S. agency officials support budget and administrative subcommittees in three of the four organizations and promote the participation of U.S. experts on independent audit committees, as shown in table 4. For example, according to officials, State plays a significant role in promoting policies on oversight and accountability at the four organizations through formal engagement in deliberations and decision-making of each organization’s governing body and through informal engagement with other member states and the secretariat by recommending best practices in governance, management, and oversight.

Counterfeiters have adopted new ways to deceive consumers, such as posting pictures of authentic goods on the websites where they are selling counterfeits and posting pseudonymous reviews of their products or businesses in order to appear legitimate. The report also notes that the volume, variety, and methods of shipment of counterfeit goods seized by CBP and ICE have changed in recent years. The report recommends that CBP take steps to evaluate the effectiveness of its IPR enforcement efforts and assess what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with the private sector. The report also notes that CBP and ICE interagency collaboration on IPR enforcement is generally consistent with key practices for effective interagency collaboration.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the changes made to the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2018. Prior to 2018, payment rates for laboratory tests were based on rates charged in 1984-1985 adjusted for inflation, and there were 57 separate fee schedules for laboratory tests. However, PAMA replaced these separate fee schedules with a single national fee schedule based on private-payer rates for laboratory tests paid from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. The payment rates for individual laboratory tests were generally based on the median private-payer rates for a given test, weighted by test volume. Payment for panel tests also changed in 2018. For panel tests without billing codes, Medicare Administrative Contractors no longer counted the number of component tests performed to determine the bundled payment rate; instead, Medicare paid the separate rate for each component test in the panel. For panel tests with a billing code, the payment rate depended on how the laboratory submitted the claim. The report also discusses the three laboratory types that receive the most revenue from the CLFS: independent laboratories, hospital-outreach laboratories, and physician-office laboratories. Private-payer rates for laboratory tests conducted by these laboratory types generally vary by type and other characteristics. The report also discusses the challenges CMS faces in setting accurate Medicare payment rates due to incomplete private-payer data. PAMA's provision directing CMS to phase in payment-rate reductions to Medicare payment rates likely moderates the potential adverse effects of incomplete private-payer data. However, in the future, failing to collect complete data could substantially affect Medicare payment rates because private-payer rates alone will determine Medicare payment rates. The report recommends that CMS take steps to collect all data from all laboratories that are required to report, phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018, and use bundled rates for panel tests, consistent with its practice prior to 2018. The report also estimates that Medicare expenditures on laboratory tests will be $733 million higher from 2018 through 2020, because CMS started phasing in payment-rate reductions from national limitation amounts instead of more relevant data on actual payment rates, such as average allowable amounts. Finally, changes to payment rates, billing practices, and testing practices could increase Medicare expenditures by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020, if CMS does not address the risks associated with unbundling payment rates for panel tests.\n"

It also explains the doctrine of federal preemption and how it applies to banking regulation. The report provides a brief history of the American \"dual banking system\" and discusses the Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, which held that federal law preempts state laws that \"significantly interfere\" with the powers of national banks. The report reviews two Supreme Court decisions concerning the extent to which states may exercise \"visitorial powers\" over national banks and discusses the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC's) preemption rules and provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act concerning the preemption of state consumer protection laws. The report outlines current issues in banking preemption, including the extent to which non-banks can benefit from federal preemption of state usury laws, the OCC's decision to grant special purpose national bank charters to financial technology (FinTech) companies, and proposals to provide legal protections to banks serving marijuana businesses that comply with state law. The report concludes by discussing the implications of the Supreme Court's decision in Barnett Bank and the OCC's 2004 preemption rules, as well as the OCC's 2011 preemption rules and the level of judicial deference towards them. The report also addresses current issues in banking preemption, including the \"valid when made\" doctrine, the \"true lender\" doctrine, and the OCC's decision to accept applications for national bank charters from FinTech companies.

      "Prediction: The John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler shipbuilding program is a program to build a new class of 20 fleet oilers for the Navy. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships in the program. The report discusses issues for Congress regarding the TAO-205 program, including whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the program, the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations, and whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy. The report also provides background information on the strategic and budgetary context in which the TAO-205 program and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered. The report states that the Navy's existing force of fleet oilers consists of 15 Henry J. Kaiser (TAO-187) class ships, and the TAO-205 class program was originally called the TAO(X) program. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the total procurement cost of the 20 planned TAO-205s at $12,196.1 million in then-year dollars, or an average of $609.8 million each. The report also discusses the Navy's new operational concept, Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), which could lead to the development of a fleet with larger numbers of individually smaller ships, and to more-widely dispersed Navy operations. The report states that the Navy has not assessed the effects of widely distributed operations on logistics force requirements and modifying its force structure plans accordingly, which could result in poor investment decisions as the Navy continues to build and modernize its fleet. The report also discusses the Navy's plan for the combined solicitation for the TAO-205 program, awarding a fixed price incentive block buy contract for the DD&C of the first six TAO-205s to GD/NASSCO. The report concludes by stating that the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the 5th and 6th ships in the program, and the Navy estimates the combined procurement cost of the two ships at $1,056.3 million, or an average of $528.1 million each. The report also discusses congressional action on the Navy's request for FY2020 procurement funding for the TAO-205 program and the program office's comments on the report.\n"

The competitive service consists of all civil service positions in the executive branch, except those specifically excepted by statute, presidential nomination, or the Office of Personnel Management. The competitive service includes non-executive branch positions and positions in the District of Columbia government that are specifically included in the competitive service by statute. OPM administers examinations for entrance into the competitive service, and applicants who meet the minimum requirements for entrance to an examination and are rated 70 or more in the examination are eligible for appointment in the competitive service. Employees in the competitive service are generally paid in accordance with the General Schedule, a schedule of annual basic pay rates that consists of 15 grades, designated \"GS-1\" through \"GS-15.\" Employees in the competitive service who are not serving a probationary or trial period, or have completed one year of current continuous service in a position other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less, maintain specified notice and appeal rights for adverse personnel actions. The excepted service consists of those civil service positions that are not in the competitive service or the SES. Positions in the excepted service may be designated by statute or by OPM, and are not subject to competitive examination. The SES is a cadre of high-level government administrators who manage major programs and projects within most federal agencies. While they are considered federal employees within the civil service system, the SES is governed by a regulatory structure separate from the competitive and excepted services. The SES mainly consists of \"career appointees\" chosen through a merit-based competitive hiring process. Career SES appointees who have successfully completed a one-year probationary period may be removed or subject to adverse action only for specified reasons. In response to concerns about performance and accountability of SES members employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Congress recently created special removal requirements that apply to these positions. In 2017, Congress passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which amended an existing provision concerning removal procedures for these covered senior executives.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses China's actions in the South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS), focusing on implications for U.S. strategic and policy interests. The report highlights China's island-building and base-construction activities in the Spratly Islands in the SCS, which have heightened concerns among U.S. observers that China is rapidly gaining effective control of the SCS. The report also notes that China employs its coast guard and maritime militia more regularly and extensively than its navy in its maritime sovereignty-assertion operations. The report suggests that the U.S. should respond to China's actions in the SCS and ECS by taking stronger actions, such as making a statement clarifying what the United States would do under the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty in the event of certain Chinese actions at Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal, or elsewhere in the SCS. The report also suggests that the U.S. should further increase and/or accelerate actions to strengthen the capacity of allied and partner countries in the region to maintain maritime domain awareness (MDA) and defend their maritime claims by conducting coast guard and/or navy patrols of claimed areas. The report notes that the U.S. should also take additional actions to impose costs on China for its actions in its near-seas region, such as inviting Taiwan to participate in the 2018 RIMPAC exercise. The report concludes that China's actions in the SCS and ECS challenge the principle that force or coercion should not be used as a means of settling disputes between countries, and that the U.S. should respond by defending the principle of peaceful resolution of disputes and resisting the emergence of an alternative \"might-makes-right\" approach to international affairs. The report also notes that the U.S. should continue to defend its positions on navigational rights on the high seas by citing customary international law, by demonstrating those rights with U.S. naval deployments (including those conducted under the FON program), and by having allies and partners defend the U.S. position on the EEZ issue at meetings of UNCLOS parties. The report suggests that the U.S. should also consider the potential contribution that could be made by allies such as Japan, the Philippines, Australia, the UK, and France, as well as potential or emerging partner countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. The report concludes that the U.S. should have a clear understanding of which actions are intended to support which goals, and maintain an alignment of actions with policy goals.

      "Prediction: The report examines the use of selected legislative authorities by the Department of Defense (DOD) labs to foster innovation and efficiency. The report identifies four authorities that have the potential to be the most crucial for supporting innovation within DOD labs: Laboratory Initiated Research Authority, Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program, Direct Hire Authority, and Micro-purchase Authority. The report also identifies and describes governance models used by selected DOD-sponsored federally funded research centers and university affiliated research centers, as well as non-defense labs, specifically at the Department of Energy (Energy) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The report recommends that the Secretary of the Air Force assess the potential costs and benefits of implementing accounting system improvements that would allow the Air Force Research Laboratory to charge customers a fixed percentage fee on provided science and technology activities to the extent allowed under the laboratory initiated research authority. The report also recommends that the Secretary of the Navy clarify whether and how to use the laboratory initiated research authority within the Capital Investment Program and that the Secretary of the Army assess existing Army policy for laboratory initiated research authority and determine whether to implement changes to eliminate disincentives for lab usage of the authority. Overall, the report highlights the importance of these authorities in supporting innovation within DOD labs and the need for service leadership to better understand and potentially remove barriers to more fully use laboratory initiated research tools.\n"

The report identifies programs frequently used to provide financial assistance in the disaster response and recovery process. The report also provides brief descriptive information to help congressional offices determine which programs merit further consideration in the planning, organization, or execution of the disaster response and recovery process. The report satisfies one or more of the following criteria: Congress expressly designated the program to provide financial assistance for disaster relief or recovery, the program is applicable to most disaster situations, even if not specifically authorized for that purpose, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other federal agencies have frequently used the program to provide financial assistance, or the program is potentially useful for addressing short-term and long-term recovery needs. The report also includes general assistance programs that may apply to disaster situations. The report notes that Congress may, and frequently has, authorized specific forms of financial assistance on a limited basis following particular disasters.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the federal matching funds for Medicaid programs and the reporting requirements for states. States must report their expenditures quarterly to CMS on the CMS-64 form, which captures expenditure data for different aspects of their Medicaid programs. States report their expenditures at an aggregate level, such as a state's total expenditures for inpatient hospital services, and these reported expenditures are not linked to individual enrollees or services. States' reporting may vary depending on the features of their Medicaid program. CMS is responsible for assuring that expenditures reported by states are supported and allowable, meaning that the state actually made and recorded the expenditure and that the expenditure is consistent with Medicaid requirements. CMS uses quarterly reviews to assess whether expenditures are supported by the state's accounting systems; are in accordance with CMS-approved methodologies, plans, and spending caps; and whether there are significant unexplained variances from one quarter to the next. CMS also uses focused financial management reviews (FMRs) to investigate expenditures in greater depth and detail than is reasonable within the timeframes of a quarterly review. However, the report found weaknesses in how CMS targets its oversight resources to address risks. CMS has allocated similar staff resources to states with differing levels of risk, and CMS has not conducted a comprehensive, national assessment of risk to determine whether resources for financial oversight activities are adequate and allocated commensurate with risk. The report also found that CMS's procedures for reviewing service expenditures reported for the Medicaid expansion population do not account for varying risks across states. The report recommends that CMS complete a comprehensive, national risk assessment and take steps to assure that resources to oversee expenditures reported by states are adequate and allocated based on areas of highest risk. The report also recommends clarifying internal guidance on when a variance analysis on higher matched expenditures is required and revising the sampling methodology for reviewing expenditures for the Medicaid expansion population to better target reviews to areas of high risk. The report concludes that the growth of federal Medicaid expenditures makes it critically important to assure expenditures are consistent with Medicaid requirements, and that CMS's review procedures have resulted in CMS resolving errors that have saved the federal government a considerable amount of money. However, the increasing complexity of expenditure reporting is occurring as resources to review these expenditures are decreasing, hindering CMS's ability to target risk and potentially allowing for hundreds of millions of federal dollars in errors to go undetected. \n",

The report highlights the significant opposition that the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has faced from the country's security establishment, which has produced four presidents: Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Hosni Mubarak, and Abdel Fattah el Sisi. The report also discusses the recent political turmoil in Egypt, which culminated in the one-year presidency of the Muslim Brotherhood's Muhammad Morsi. The report notes that the Muslim Brotherhood's rule exposed deep divisions in Egyptian politics, pitting a broad cross-section of Egypt's public and private sectors, the Coptic Church, and the military against the Brotherhood and its Islamist supporters.

      "Prediction: The Department of Defense (DOD) defines a hosted payload as an instrument or package of equipment integrated onto a host satellite, which operates on orbit making use of the host satellite’s available resources. The report discusses the benefits of using commercially hosted payloads, including cost savings, faster on-orbit capability, increased deterrence and resilience, and continual technology upgrades and industrial base stability. However, DOD officials identified logistical challenges to matching government payloads with any given commercial host satellite, such as size, weight, and power constraints. Additionally, aligning the development and acquisition timelines of a government payload and commercial host satellite is a challenge due to the longer development time for government sensors. DOD officials also expressed concerns with combining government and commercial space missions, such as loss of control over a hosted payload and cybersecurity concerns. The report recommends that DOD require programs using hosted payloads to provide cost and technical data, and lessons learned to a central office. The Hosted Payload Office is developing tools designed to help address these challenges and DOD offices that have used hosted payloads have also found ways to overcome them. The report concludes that DOD would benefit from leveraging the knowledge and information gained from each hosted payload experience and centralizing agency-wide data to mitigate logistical challenges and better position DOD to make reasoned, evidence-based decisions on whether a hosted payload would be a viable solution to meet warfighter needs.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the demographic trends in the technology workforce over the past decade and assesses the efforts by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) to oversee technology companies and technology contractors’ compliance with equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements. The report finds that technology workers have a higher median income than workers in the general workforce, but women, Black, and Hispanic workers are less represented in the technology workforce compared to their representation in the general workforce. The report also finds that companies in the technology sector employ non-technical workers, such as sales people, and that the lower representation of female, Hispanic, and Black workers in the technology sector may be due to factors such as lower diversity of degree earners in technology-related fields, and company-based factors such as hiring practices and retention of women and underrepresented minorities. The report recommends that EEOC develop a timeline to complete its planned effort to clean IMS data for a one-year period and add missing industry code data, and that OFCCP analyze internal process data from closed evaluations to better understand the cause of delays that occur during compliance evaluations and make changes accordingly. The report also recommends that OFCCP take steps toward requiring contractors to disaggregate demographic data for the purpose of setting placement goals in the AAP rather than setting a single goal for all minorities, and that OFCCP assess the quality of the methods used by OFCCP to incorporate consideration of disparities by industry into its process for selecting contractor establishments for compliance evaluation. Finally, the report recommends that OFCCP evaluate the current approach used for identifying entities for compliance review and determine whether modifications are needed to reflect current workplace structures and locations or to ensure that subcontractors are included, and that OFCCP evaluate the Functional Affirmative Action Program to assess its usefulness as an effective alternative to an establishment-based program, and determine what improvements, if any, could be made to better encourage contractor participation.\n"

      "Prediction: The CHIP-IN Act was passed in 2017 to test innovative approaches to meeting VA's infrastructure needs. The act authorized a total of five pilot projects, but did not name any specific project locations. The Omaha donor group applied to participate in the pilot program with the construction of an ambulatory care center, and VA executed a donation agreement in April 2017. The CHIP-IN Act places certain requirements on donations under the pilot program, including that the property must have already received appropriations for a VA facility project or be identified as a need as part of VA's long-range capital planning process. The CHIP-IN Act also requires that a formal agreement between VA and the non-federal entity provide that the entity conduct necessary environmental and historic preservation due diligence, obtain permits, and use construction standards required of VA, though the VA Secretary may permit exceptions. VA officials have worked to communicate with relevant stakeholders, but have not yet established objectives, developed an assessment methodology and evaluation plan, or documented how they will make decisions about scalability of the pilot program. The purpose of a pilot is to generally inform a decision on whether and how to implement a new approach in a broader context—or in other words, whether the pilot can be scaled up or increased in size to a larger number of projects over the long term. VA officials have begun to implement this leading practice by considering the pilot as a means of testing the viability of the donation partnership approach; however, plans for assessing scalability have not been fully defined and documented. The CHIP-IN donation approach can result in potential cost and time savings—through the leveraging of private-sector funding, contracting, and construction practices—according to VA officials and the Omaha donor group. However, the reliance on large philanthropic donations is a challenge to establishing pilot partnerships. VA officials and Omaha donor group representatives acknowledged that a dedicated CHIP-IN team could help focus pilot implementation—and that no such team existed within the agency. The Secretary of VA should ensure that internal stakeholders—such as the CHIP-IN steering committee’s members—agree to and document clear, measurable objectives for the CHIP-IN pilot that will help inform decisions about whether and how to scale the program. The Secretary of VA should ensure that internal stakeholders—such as the CHIP-IN steering committee’s members—develop an assessment methodology and an evaluation plan that are linked to objectives for the CHIP-IN pilot and that help inform decisions about whether and how to scale the program.

      "Prediction: The report examines the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) efforts to address lead paint hazards in federally-assisted housing. HUD has primary responsibility for addressing lead paint hazards in federally-assisted housing, but EPA also has responsibilities related to setting federal lead standards for housing. The report focuses on HUD's lead hazard control grant programs and its two largest rental assistance programs that serve the most families with children: the Housing Choice Voucher and public housing programs. The report identifies several areas where HUD could improve the effectiveness of its efforts to identify and address lead paint hazards and protect children in low-income housing from lifelong health problems. These areas include documenting and evaluating grant processes, identifying areas at risk for lead hazards, overseeing compliance with lead paint regulations, amending inspection standards in the voucher program, and assessing and reporting on performance. The report makes nine recommendations to HUD to improve its lead efforts, including developing comprehensive goals and performance measures, periodically evaluating grant processes, and establishing procedures to determine when enforcement decisions are needed. The report also notes that HUD has not reported on its lead efforts as required since 1997 and recommends that HUD complete statutory reporting requirements and make the report publicly available. Overall, the report highlights the importance of HUD's efforts to address lead paint hazards in federally-assisted housing and provides recommendations for improving these efforts.\n"

      "Prediction: The GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA) was enacted in 2011 to address persistent federal performance challenges and provide greater accountability for results. The report assesses how implementation of GPRAMA has affected the federal government's progress in resolving key governance challenges in addressing crosscutting issues, ensuring performance information is useful and used in decision making, aligning daily operations with results, and building a more transparent and open government. The report found that while some progress has been made, there are still opportunities for improvement. For example, agencies could increase the use of performance information in decision making and the likelihood of achieving desired results by expanding the use of data-driven performance reviews beyond APGs to more broadly cover other agency-wide performance goals, as well as goals at lower levels within the agency. The report also recommends that OMB update Performance.gov to explain that quarterly reporting on the fiscal year 2014 through 2017 CAP goals and fiscal year 2016 and 2017 APGs was suspended, and provide the location of final progress updates for these goals. Additionally, the report recommends that OMB revise and publicly issue OMB guidance to provide time frames and associated milestones for implementing the federal program inventory. The report also recommends that OMB work with the Performance Improvement Council to identify and share among agencies practices for expanding the use of data-driven performance reviews beyond APGs, such as for other performance goals and at lower levels within agencies, that have led to performance improvements. Overall, the report highlights the importance of fully implementing GPRAMA's crosscutting provisions to better manage crosscutting issues and enhance collaboration.\n"

      "Prediction: The Colorado River Basin covers over 246,000 square miles and runs through seven US states and Mexico. The Bureau of Reclamation plays a significant role in managing the basin's waters, particularly in the Lower Basin where it serves as water master on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior. The federal government's role is magnified by the multiple federally owned and operated water storage and conveyance facilities in the basin, which provide low-cost water and hydropower supplies to water users. Colorado River water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation and municipal and industrial purposes, and its flow and stored water are important for power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. Precipitation and runoff in the basin are highly variable, and water conditions depend largely on snowmelt in the basin's northern areas. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 established a framework to apportion the water supplies between the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin, with the dividing line between the two basins at Lee Ferry, AZ. The compact did not address inter- or intrastate allocations of water, nor did it address water to be made available to Mexico, the river's natural terminus; this matter was addressed in subsequent international agreements. The compact was not to become binding until it had been approved by the legislatures of each of the signatory states and by Congress. Congress approved and modified the Colorado River Compact in the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928. The act ratified the 1922 compact, authorized the construction of a federal facility to impound water in the Lower Basin (Boulder Dam, later renamed Hoover Dam) and related facilities to deliver water in Southern California (e.g., the All-American Canal, which delivers Colorado River water to California's Imperial Valley), and apportioned the Lower Basin's 7.5 MAF per year among the three Lower Basin states. It also directed the Secretary of the Interior to serve as the sole contracting authority for Colorado River water use in the Lower Basin and authorized several storage projects for study in the Upper Basin. The Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 authorized storage reservoirs and dams in the Upper Basin, including the Glen Canyon, Flaming Gorge, Navajo, and Curecanti Dams. The act also established the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund, which receives revenues collected in connection with the projects, to be made available for defraying the project's costs of operation, maintenance, and emergency expenditures. In addition to the aforementioned authorization of CAP in Arizona, the 1968 CRBPA amended\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the extent to which government-wide data on collections of fees, fines, and penalties are publicly available and useful for the purpose of congressional oversight. It also assesses the benefits and challenges to government-wide reporting of specific fees, fines, and penalties, including data elements that facilitate congressional oversight. The report finds that while there are some government-wide sources of data with information on collections of fees, fines, and penalties, there is no source of data that lists all collections of specific fees, fines, and penalties at a government-wide or agency level. The report recommends that the Director of OMB make available more disaggregated data on fees, fines, and penalties that it maintains in its OMB MAX database, present data limitations related to the government-wide fee totals in Analytical Perspectives, instruct agencies to regularly review the application of the user fee designation in the OMB MAX data, and describe in the Public Budget Database User’s Guide that budget authority is reported net of any offsetting collections, including collections of fees, fines, and penalties. The report also identifies potential challenges to defining the government-wide data standard or definition of fee, fine, and penalty programs by which agencies could report. Overall, the report concludes that government-wide reporting of fees, fines, and penalties could increase transparency and facilitate oversight and decision-making, but would require time and resources to develop given that there is currently no government-wide system or requirements for agencies to collect and report detailed fee, fine, and penalty data.\n"

      "Prediction: The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs to encourage lenders to provide loans to small businesses that might not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms and conditions. The SBA's 7(a) loan guaranty program is considered the agency's flagship loan program. In FY2018, the SBA approved 60,353 7(a) loans totaling nearly $25.4 billion. The average approved 7(a) loan amount was $420,401. The total number and amount of SBA 7(a) loans approved declined in FY2008 and FY2009, increased during FY2010 and FY2011, declined somewhat in FY2012, and have increased since then. The SBA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) have independently reviewed the SBA's administration of the SBA's loan guaranty programs, and although improvements have been noted, both agencies have reported deficiencies in the SBA's administration of its loan guaranty programs that they argue need to be addressed, including issues involving the oversight of 7(a) lenders and the lack of outcome-based performance measures. The SBA has made significant progress in improving its oversight of SBA lenders, but the OIG continues to list lender oversight as one of the most serious management challenges facing the SBA because it argues that several issues that it has identified in audits have not been fully addressed. The SBA has created an annual Enterprise Learning Agenda designed to help program managers continue to build and use evidence and to foster an environment of continuous learning. The SBA has also formed an impact evaluation working group to develop a methodology for conducting impact evaluations of the agency's programs using administrative data sources residing at the SBA and in other federal agencies. The SBA has waived the up-front, one-time loan guaranty fee and ongoing servicing fee for 7(a) loans of $150,000 or less approved in FY2014 and FY2015 as a means to encourage the demand for smaller 7(a) loans. The SBA has also waived the up-front, one-time loan guaranty fee for 7(a) loans of $125,000 or less approved in FY2018.

      "Prediction: The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) provides free meals to children in low-income areas during school vacations. The program has been in operation since 1968 and is administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at the federal level. The SFSP operates during school summer vacation periods, vacation periods in any month for programs operating on a continuous school calendar, and certain other times for areas affected by an unanticipated school closure. The majority of SFSP meals are served to children during the summer months. In fiscal years 2007 through 2016, federal expenditures on SFSP increased, although there was a slight decrease between fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The SFSP is administered at the federal level by FNS through its national and regional offices. FNS is responsible for issuing regulations, instructions, and guidance; reviewing states’ program management and administration plans; overseeing program administration; and reimbursing states for meals served that meet program requirements. At the state level, the program is administered by state agencies and locally operated by state-approved sponsors, such as school districts, local government entities, or private nonprofit organizations. State agencies are responsible for approving, providing training to, and inspecting and monitoring sponsors and meal sites. Sponsors, in turn, are responsible for monitoring their SFSP meal sites, managing the meal service, and providing training to administrative staff and site operators. A sponsor may operate one site or multiple sites. Sites are physical locations in the community where children receive and consume meals in a supervised setting. According to FNS guidance, sites may be located in a variety of settings, including schools, parks, community centers, health clinics, hospitals, apartment complexes, churches, and migrant camps. States may approve different types of SFSP meal sites, including open sites, closed enrolled sites, and camps. Open sites operate in an area where at least half of the children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals (referred to as “area eligible”), according to data from entities such as schools or the U.S. Census Bureau. Children are generally eligible for free or reduced-price school meals if their households have incomes at or below 185 percent of federal poverty guidelines. At open sites, meals are made available to all children in the area, and all meals served that meet program requirements are reimbursable. Closed enrolled sites, on the other hand, are open only to enrolled children, as opposed to the community at large. At closed enrolled sites, meals served to all children in attendance are reimbursable\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the Medicare program, which provides health insurance for individuals aged 65 and over, certain individuals with disabilities, and individuals with end-stage renal disease. The report highlights the challenges associated with fraud in the Medicare program, including the difficulty in detecting fraud due to intentional deception. The report also notes that there are no reliable estimates of the extent of fraud in the Medicare program or in the health-care industry as a whole. The report recommends that the Administrator of CMS provide fraud-awareness training relevant to risks facing CMS programs and require new hires to undergo such training and all employees to undergo training on a recurring basis. The report also recommends that the Administrator of CMS conduct fraud risk assessments for Medicare and Medicaid to include respective fraud risk profiles and plans for regularly updating the assessments and profiles. The report notes that CMS has established monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for its program-integrity activities that it could incorporate into an antifraud strategy. The report also notes that CMS has not developed and documented a risk-based antifraud strategy to guide its design and implementation of new antifraud activities and to better align and coordinate its existing activities to ensure it is targeting and mitigating the most-significant fraud risks. The report recommends that CMS develop an antifraud strategy that is clearly articulated to various CMS stakeholders and that includes plans for refining and building on existing methods such as return-on-investment or savings measures, and setting appropriate targets to evaluate the effectiveness of all of CMS’s antifraud efforts. Overall, the report emphasizes the importance of a strategic approach to managing fraud risks within the Medicare program, particularly in light of the constantly evolving fraud schemes and the large size and complexity of the program.\n"

      "Prediction: The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for administering three programs: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Supplemental Security Income. The agency relies heavily on its IT resources to support the administration of its programs and related activities. However, SSA has been challenged in its management of IT, and the agency has previously issued a number of reports highlighting various weaknesses in the agency's system development practices, governance, requirements management, and strategic planning. To address these weaknesses, SSA has taken steps to improve its management of IT acquisitions and operations by implementing 14 of the 15 recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) from 2011 through 2018. However, SSA has not fully addressed the role of the CIO in its policies, which is essential to helping the agency overcome its longstanding IT management challenges. The GAO recommends that SSA ensure that its policies fully address the role and responsibilities of its CIO in the five key management areas: leadership and accountability, strategic planning, IT workforce, IT budgeting, IT investment management, and information security. By taking these actions, SSA should be better positioned to effectively address longstanding IT management challenges. The GAO also notes that SSA has made progress in improving its IT management in the areas of data center consolidation, incremental development, IT acquisitions, and software licenses. Overall, effective IT management is critical to the performance of SSA's mission, and the agency must continue to work towards improving its IT management practices to ensure that it can effectively deliver Social Security services to the public.\n"

      "Prediction: The federal government collects various fees and charges from businesses and households, which can be classified as user fees, intragovernmental transactions, or regulatory or judicial activities. User fees are voluntary payments that connect the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and they can help decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. The statutory basis for each particular fee or user charge varies in specificity and in the degree of discretion granted to the executive branch. User fees have several advantages as a means of financing public activities, including being voluntary, connecting the burden of financing activities to those who directly benefit from them, and helping to decentralize decisionmaking by bypassing centralized allocation of resources. However, the flow of user fees and charges may reflect fluctuations in economic conditions, which may complicate the financing of government operations. Some are also concerned that funding arrangements may bypass regular congressional scrutiny and dilute Congress's power of the purse. The report also discusses the economic suitability of the benefit principle, which suggests linking the fiscal burden of publicly provided benefits to those who enjoy those benefits, and the concept of Pigou taxation, which suggests taxing goods linked to negative spillovers to enhance economic efficiency. The report also notes that while public corporations operating on a largely commercial basis, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, may set prices and fees much as a private firm would, many of the federal government's activities are within the public sector because past policymakers considered them to be closely associated with inherently governmental functions—such as providing security—or as services that the private sector would have had trouble providing, such as basic research. The report concludes by noting that while user fees can be an effective means of financing public activities, policymakers should consider the economic suitability of the benefit principle and the concept of Pigou taxation when designing fees, charges, or taxes that directly influence activities generating negative spillovers.\n"

The report also explains the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, which is a framework for managing DOD real property assets and funds the construction, maintenance, operation, and disposal of military infrastructure. The report highlights the key milestones of a typical BRAC timeline, including DOD force structure plan, infrastructure inventory, and analysis of options, nomination and confirmation of BRAC commissioners, DOD submission of BRAC recommendations, commission deliberations, final report sent to the President for approval, 45-day deadline for Congress to reject recommendations in their entirety, DOD implementation, and DOD disposal of real property. The report also discusses the transfer and disposal of DOD real property made available following the implementation of a BRAC round, which is a complex process that may extend for years beyond the initial six-year implementation window. The report concludes by discussing the potential cost savings and efficiencies that could be achieved through a new BRAC round, as well as the challenges and criticisms of the BRAC process.

To be eligible, IHEs must meet basic eligibility criteria, including offering at least one eligible program of education, and satisfy the program integrity triad, which includes being legally authorized to provide a postsecondary education in the state in which it is located, accredited or preaccredited by an agency recognized by the Department of Education (ED), and certified by ED as eligible to participate in Title IV programs. The report also discusses several issues that are closely related to institutional eligibility, including Program Participation Agreements, campus safety policies and crime reporting required under the Clery Act, the return of Title IV funds, and distance education. The report provides a general overview of HEA provisions that affect a postsecondary institution's eligibility for participation in Title IV student aid programs. It first describes general eligibility criteria at both the institutional and programmatic level and then, in more detail, the program integrity triad. The report also discusses several issues that are closely related to institutional eligibility, including Program Participation Agreements, campus safety policies and crime reporting required under the Clery Act, the return of Title IV funds, and distance education.

The report highlights the importance of vaccination strategies in controlling and eradicating FMD, and notes that relying solely on stamping out may not be effective or feasible in many potential scenarios. The report also identifies 11 challenge areas that USDA would likely face in responding to an FMD outbreak, including surveillance, diagnosis, information management, traceability, biosecurity, depopulation, disposal, resources, communication and coordination, and compensation. The report recommends that USDA follow its SOP to prioritize corrective actions for FMD preparedness and to monitor progress and track completion of corrective actions.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the use of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders and the efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand access to MAT. MAT combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain medications to treat opioid use disorders. The report highlights the three medications currently approved by the FDA for use in MAT: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. The report also discusses the challenges associated with expanding access to MAT, including the limited number of providers available to treat patients who may benefit from MAT. The report notes that HHS has implemented several grant programs to increase access to MAT, including the Targeted Capacity Expansion: Medication Assisted Treatment – Prescription Drug and Opioid Addiction (MAT-PDOA) grant program, the Substance Abuse Service Expansion Supplement to Health Centers grant program, the Increasing Access to Medication-Assisted Treatment in Rural Primary Care Practices grant program, and the State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis Grants (Opioid STR) grant program. The report also notes that HHS has taken steps to prevent the possibility that the MAT medications could be diverted for illicit use, misuse, or for purposes not intended by a prescriber. The report recommends that HHS establish performance measures with targets related to expanding access to MAT for opioid use disorders and establish timeframes in its evaluation approach that specify when its evaluation of efforts to expand access to MAT will be implemented and completed. The report concludes by noting that while HHS has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in its MAT-related grant programs, it is too early to determine how effective HHS's efforts have been in expanding access to MAT and in meeting HHS's other priorities related to addressing the opioid epidemic.\n"

      "Prediction: The Holman rule is a congressional rule that separates questions of policy from questions of funding. It states that legislation that establishes, continues, or modifies the organization or activities of a federal entity or program cannot provide funding for such purposes. Instead, the authority to obligate payments from the Treasury is left to separate appropriations measures. The rule was first established in 1835 and has been modified several times since then. The rule currently states that a provision changing existing law may not be reported in a general appropriation bill, except for germane provisions that retrench expenditures by the reduction of amounts of money covered by the bill. The rule is intended to apply only when an obvious reduction of funds in a general appropriations bill is achieved by the provision in question. The rule does not apply to funds other than those appropriated in the pending general appropriations bill. The rule is not intended to open the door for legislative provisions that would expand the scope of the bill. The Holman rule is not intended to circumscribe Congress's lawmaking authority but rather provides a limited exception to the general prohibition in House rules against legislation in appropriation measures. The rule has been interpreted through precedents that have tended to incrementally narrow its application. The additional language in the separate order for the 115 th Congress opened the door to the consideration of retrenchments resulting from a reduction of the number and salary of the officers of the United States or the reduction of the compensation of any person paid out of the Treasury of the United States. However, the application of the broader exceptions in the separate order were still subject to the general requirement for germaneness.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the challenges faced by runaway and homeless youth, including untreated mental health disorders, drug use, and sexual exploitation. It also highlights the lack of basic provisions and poor health experienced by these youth. The report provides an overview of federal efforts to support runaway and homeless youth, including the evolution of federal policies to respond to these youth, with a focus on the period from the Runaway Youth Act of 1974 to the present time. The report describes the administration and funding of the Basic Center, Transitional Living, and Street Outreach programs that were created from authorizations in the act. The appendixes include funding information for the BCP program and discuss other federal programs that may be used to assist runaway and homeless youth. The report also discusses the challenges in defining and counting this population, as well as the factors that influence homelessness and leaving home. The report concludes by outlining a strategy to strengthen and coordinate the capacity of federal, state, and local systems to work toward ending youth homelessness. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program is a major part of recent federal efforts to end youth homelessness through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. The USICH, established under the 1987 Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, is made up of several federal agencies, including HHS and HUD. The HEARTH Act, enacted in 2009 as part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act (P.L. 111-22), charged USICH with developing a National Strategic Plan to End Homelessness. In June 2010, USICH released this plan, entitled Opening Doors. The plan set out goals for ending homelessness, including (1) ending chronic homelessness by 2015; (2) preventing and ending homelessness among veterans by 2015; (3) preventing and ending homelessness for families, youth, and children by 2020; and (4) setting a path to ending all types of homelessness. In 2012, USICH amended Opening Doors to specifically address strategies for improving the educational outcomes for children and youth and assisting unaccompanied homeless youth. USICH outlined its intention to improve outcomes for youth in four areas: stable housing, permanent connections, education or employment options, and socio-emotional well-being. In 2013, a USICH working group developed a guiding document for ending youth homelessness by 2020. Known as the Framework to End Youth Homelessness, the document outlines a data strategy to collect better data on the number and characteristics of youth experiencing homelessness. This data strategy includes coordinating\n"

The three agencies are funded through the annual Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations. The report provides a review of these trade agencies' programs and compares the Administration's FY2019 request with FY2018 funding. The Administration requested a total of $590.8 million for the three CJS trade-related agencies, which represented an 8.9% decrease in funding from the FY2018 appropriated amount. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees largely declined the budget cuts requested by the Administration for these three trade agencies. The final FY2019 appropriations included a total of $647.0 million in funding for the three trade-related agencies, a 0.2% decrease from FY2018 appropriations. The report also discusses the specific programs and units within each agency, including ITA's Global Markets, Industry and Analysis, and Enforcement and Compliance units, USITC's investigations and independent technical advice, and USTR's role in developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and direct investment policies.

      "Prediction: The report suggests that the state and local government sector will likely face a difference between revenue and spending during the next 50 years. The operating balance, which measures the sector's ability to cover its current expenditures out of current receipts, is projected to persist because expenditures are generally expected to grow at a faster rate than revenues. The simulations suggest that state and local governments will need to make policy changes to avoid fiscal imbalances before then and assure that revenues are at least equal to expenditures. The report also suggests that growth in the sector's overall spending is largely driven by health care expenditures, which are projected to increase from about 4.1 percent of GDP in 2018 to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2067. Medicaid spending and spending on health benefits for state and local government employees and retirees are likely to constitute a growing expenditure for state and local governments during the simulation period. The report also notes that federal grants overall will increase as a share of GDP, while Medicaid grants will likely grow more quickly than other types of federal grants. The report highlights the potential impact of recent federal policy changes related to taxes and health care on the long-term fiscal position of state and local governments. The report also notes that a weakening of the economy could add to the fiscal pressures states face in funding their Medicaid obligations. The report concludes by noting that changes in the growth projections of key model variables, such as economic growth, health care excess cost growth, and the rate of return on pension assets, could affect the operating balance of state and local governments, thereby shifting future fiscal outcomes for the sector. The report recommends that federal policy makers and state and local governments consider how these changes could affect the long-term outlook.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the United States Marine Corps' need for amphibious and land operations capabilities, as required by law. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) and Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) were considered integral systems to meet this legal requirement, as well as providing critical capabilities to execute the nation's military strategy. However, the Marine Corps cancelled the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program due to excessive cost growth and poor performance in operational testing. The ACV is intended to replace the AAV, incorporating some EFV capabilities but in a more practical and cost-efficient manner. The MPC was not intended to be amphibious like an AAV, EFV, or the ACV but instead would be required to have a swim capability for inland waterways such as rivers, lakes, and other water obstacles such as shore-to-shore operations in the littorals. The Marines have refocused budgetary resources to the ACV as well as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV). The Marines plan to develop ACV Increment 1.1, a tracked version, and to acquire about 470 vehicles and fund an ongoing high water speed study. The Marines plan to equip six battalions with ACV 1.1s and 392 existing upgraded AAVs. The Marines selected BAE Systems to produce the ACV, with the initial contract valued at $198 million. The Marines plan to develop an ACV 2.0, capable of carrying 10 to 13 Marines plus crew, capable of high water speeds and deployment from ships far from the coast. The consolidation of ACV 1.1 and ACV 1.2 variants could be viewed as a favourable programmatic outcome, but there are potential ramifications that might be of interest to policymakers. The adoption of Expeditionary Advance Base Operations (EABO) as an operational concept could possibly have implications for the ACV program, including the following: At the weapon systems level, would EABO require any changes to the vehicles themselves, such as enhanced survivability, lethality, or Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) features? If changes are required to facilitate EABO, how would this affect the program's overall acquisition timeline and cost? If EABO does not require any technical changes in the ACV program, would the adoption of EABO modify the Marines' current procurement quantities of ACVs? If EABO requires different procurement quantities for the different AC\n"

      "Prediction: The Department of Defense (DOD) establishes foreign currency budget rates for each fiscal year to determine its funding needs and calculate any gains or losses that result from DOD’s overseas expenditures. DOD uses various methodologies for establishing the foreign currency budget rates, and in 2017, DOD adjusted its methodology to establish the foreign currency budget rates. The report analyzes DOD’s use of revised foreign currency budget rates during fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and found that the revised budget rates for those years were more closely aligned with rates published by Treasury. The report also found that DOD’s use of revised foreign currency budget rates decreased DOD’s projected O&M and MILPERS funding needs and any potential gains or losses that would have occurred due to foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal years 2014 through 2016. The report recommends that DOD conduct a review of the foreign currency rates used at disbursement to determine whether cost-saving opportunities exist by more consistently selecting cost-effective rates at disbursement. The report also recommends that DOD analyze realized and projected losses to determine the necessary size of the FCFD account balance and use the results of this analysis as the basis for transfers of unobligated balances to the account. Finally, the report recommends that DOD revise the Financial Management Regulation to include guidance on ensuring that data are complete and accurate, including assignment of responsibility for correcting erroneous data in its Foreign Currency Fluctuations Defense (O&M) reports. The report also recommends that the Secretary of the Army develop a plan with timelines for implementing changes to its General Fund Enterprise Business System to accurately record its disbursements, consistent with DOD Financial Management Regulation guidance. Overall, the report highlights the importance of effective management of foreign currency gains and losses, as well as any projected gains or losses for any remaining obligations that have not yet been liquidated through disbursement, in order to ensure the most efficient use of resources.\n"

      "Prediction: The report by the government agency discusses the progress and challenges faced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in managing the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program. The report highlights the issues related to identifying high-risk chemical facilities, assessing risk and prioritizing facilities, reviewing and approving facility security plans, conducting facility compliance inspections, and stakeholder outreach and feedback. The report also mentions the programmatic changes made by DHS in recent years that may impact its progress in addressing open recommendations. The report recommends that DHS work with other agencies to develop and implement methods of improving data sharing among agencies and with states as members of a Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group. DHS has made progress in addressing the backlog of security plans awaiting review and has implemented an Expedited Approval Program (EAP) for tier 3 and tier 4 chemical facilities. However, the report notes that recent changes made to the CFATS program could affect the future use of the EAP. The report also recommends that DHS document processes and procedures for managing compliance to provide more reasonable assurance that facilities implement planned measures and address security gaps. The report concludes by stating that DHS has made progress in addressing the challenges faced by the CFATS program, but there is still work to be done to ensure the program's effectiveness. The report will be updated later this summer with further findings and recommendations.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement's (OSMRE) oversight activities related to coal mine reclamation. Coal accounted for 17 percent of energy production in the United States in 2016, with approximately 730 million tons of coal mined domestically. The report highlights the challenges facing OSMRE and state regulatory authorities in managing financial assurances for coal mine reclamation, including those related to self-bonding, unanticipated reclamation costs, and the financial stability of surety companies. The report recommends that Congress consider amending SMCRA to eliminate the use of self-bonding as a type of financial assurance for coal mine reclamation. The report also notes that OSMRE has taken steps to oversee financial assurances and aspects of the mining and reclamation process that can affect whether the amount of financial assurances obtained will cover the cost of required reclamation. The report provides examples of states that have established alternative bonding systems, such as bond pools, and notes that states can use civil penalties collected from operators that violate conditions of their mining permits to reclaim forfeited mines. The report also notes that OSMRE has conducted national and regional reviews on specific topics, such as how state regulatory authorities calculate financial assurance amounts. The report concludes that while OSMRE and state regulatory authorities face challenges in managing financial assurances for coal mine reclamation, billions have been spent to reclaim mines abandoned prior to the financial assurance requirements SMCRA put in place, and billions more remain.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the use of continuing appropriations acts, also known as continuing resolutions or CRs, to provide interim budget authority for federal agencies when regular appropriations acts are delayed. The report explains that funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year or at any time a CR expires and another CR (or the relevant regular appropriations bill) is not enacted immediately thereafter. The report also discusses the Antideficiency Act, which generally bars the obligation or expenditure of federal funds in the absence of appropriations. The report explains that when a funding gap occurs, executive agencies begin a shutdown of the affected projects and activities, including the furlough of non-excepted personnel. The report notes that funding gaps have ranged in duration from 1 to 34 full days, and that multiple funding gaps may occur within a fiscal year. The report also notes that some funding gaps have not resulted in a \"shutdown\" due to the short duration of the funding gap and an expectation that appropriations would soon be enacted. The report provides examples of funding gaps that have occurred since FY1977, including the two FY1996 funding gaps, the 16-day funding gap in FY2014, the funding gap in FY2018, and the funding gap in FY2019. The report concludes by noting that funding gaps may result in a \"shutdown\" of all affected projects or activities in some instances but not in others, and that the legislative history of these funding gaps is summarized in the report.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the Department of Defense's (DOD) document services, which include printing and reproduction, device procurement, and electronic content management. The report highlights the inefficiencies in the current system, such as fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, overlap in procuring print devices, and the lack of a department-wide approach for acquiring print devices. The report also notes that DOD has taken steps towards achieving efficiencies in its document services, including implementing a transformation plan for DLA Document Services, reducing the cost and number of office-level print devices, and increasing its use of electronic content management. However, the report identifies four areas where further gains may be possible, including better managing fragmentation in printing and reproduction services, reducing overlap in procuring print devices, meeting goals to reduce the number of print devices, and consolidating locations that provide mission specialty printing. The report recommends that DOD assesses whether DLA Document Services' single manager role for printing and reproduction provides the best value to the government and whether any additional efficiencies are possible, and evaluates options to report more accurate funding information and takes steps to improve the accuracy of its budgetary and financial information reporting on document services internally and to Congress. Overall, the report suggests that DOD can do more to build on its gains and achieve further efficiencies in its document services mission.\n"

      "Prediction: The federal government owns and leases hundreds of thousands of buildings across the country that cost billions of dollars annually to operate and maintain. In recent years, the federal government has taken steps to improve the management of federal real property and address long-standing issues by undertaking several government-wide initiatives and issuing memorandums to the CFO Act agencies. The National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property was issued in March 2015 to provide a framework to guide agencies’ real property management, increase efficient real property use, control costs, and reduce federal real property. The strategy outlined three key steps to improve real property management: (1) freeze growth in the inventory; (2) measure performance and use data to identify opportunities to improve the efficiency of the real property portfolio; and (3) reduce the size of the inventory by consolidating, co-locating, and disposing of properties. The RTF policy requires agencies to: (1) submit annual Real Property Efficiency Plans (Plan) to GSA and OMB; (2) issue a policy that specifies a design standard for maximum useable square feet by workstation for use in domestic office space; (3) set and specify in their Plans annual reduction targets for their domestic office and warehouse space for a 5-year period; (4) set and specify in their Plans annual reduction targets for domestic owned building properties reported in the Federal Real Property Profile; and (5) continue to not increase the square footage of their domestic inventory of office and warehouse space. The report highlights the approaches and challenges faced by the 24 CFO Act agencies in achieving their Reduce the Footprint (RTF) reduction targets for all their domestic office and warehouse space. The report also provides examples of successful practices used to reduce their office and warehouse space. The report concludes that while agencies have made progress in reducing their real property footprints, challenges remain, including space reduction costs, mission delivery requirements, employee organization concerns, and workload growth. The report also highlights the importance of effective communication and collaboration between agencies and GSA in managing vacated space. Overall, the report emphasizes the need for continued efforts to improve the management of federal real property and reduce costs associated with operating and maintaining these buildings.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the decline of cash payments in the United States and its potential effects on the economy and society. It analyzes cash and noncash payment systems, including traditional electronic payment systems and alternative electronic payment systems using distributed ledger technology, such as cryptocurrencies. The report also examines potential outcomes if cash were to be significantly displaced as a commonly accepted form of payment. The report concludes that if noncash payment systems significantly displace cash and cash usage and acceptance significantly decline, there would be a number of effects (both positive and negative) on the economy and society. Policymakers may face decisions about whether to impede or hasten the decline of cash and consider the implications of doing so. The report includes an appendix with two international case studies of economies in which noncash payment systems rapidly expanded. Overall, the report suggests that while there are potential benefits to reducing the use of cash, there are also potential costs and risks that must be considered. \n",

      "Prediction: The report discusses the four regional power marketing administrations (PMAs) operated by the Department of Energy, including the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), the Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Each PMA operates in a distinct geographic area of the coterminous United States and markets electric power produced by federal dams constructed, owned, and operated by the Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). The PMAs must give preference to public utility districts and cooperatives, selling their power at cost-based rates set at the lowest possible rate consistent with sound business principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates PMA rates to ensure that they are set high enough to repay the U.S. Treasury on schedule for the portion of federal facility costs that have been allocated to hydropower beneficiaries. The report also discusses unique elements and regional issues that affect each PMA, including BPA's self-financing, SEPA's small size and lack of transmission facilities, SWPA's rain-based water supply, and WAPA's preference for Native American tribes. The report also mentions proposals to sell all or part of the PMAs, which have been made in some form by almost every President since Reagan, but Congress has sought to prevent executive branch alterations of PMA structures and authority. The report concludes by stating that selling federally owned transmission assets could potentially affect the \"lowest possible\" rates of sale and the statutory preference for publicly or cooperatively owned utilities to be the vehicle for sale of electric power produced by federal facilities.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the role of the minority leader in the House of Representatives, including their responsibilities and strategies for achieving their primary goal of retaking majority control. The position of minority leader is a late-19th century innovation, and the duties of the minority leader are based on tradition and custom. The minority leader serves as the leader and spokesperson for the minority party, participates in certain institutional prerogatives afforded to Members in the minority, and has a range of formal and informal party responsibilities. The minority leader has a number of strategies available to them, including cooperation, inconsequential opposition, withdrawal, innovation, and partisan opposition.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the legal landscape surrounding Title IX, which provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment committed by professors, teachers, coaches, and others at educational institutions. The Supreme Court has held that a school district can violate the statute and be held liable for damages based on a deliberately indifferent response to a teacher's sexual abuse or harassment of a student. The report examines how federal courts have understood Title IX's requirements in the context of private rights of actions brought by students directly against educational institutions seeking damages for sexual abuse or harassment. The report also examines how federal agencies have enforced Title IX, with particular focus on ED's guidance documents that direct schools on how to respond to sexual harassment and assault allegations. The report then considers various constitutional challenges brought by students against public universities, which claim that some universities' responses to allegations of sexual harassment have violated the due process rights of the accused. The report concludes by examining ED's proposed regulations with an emphasis on how they would alter the responsibilities of schools in complying with Title IX. The proposed regulation would define sexual harassment in narrower terms, require \"actual notice\" of harassment to trigger a school's Title IX responsibilities, and impose new procedural requirements that reflect concern for due process when schools investigate allegations and make determinations of culpability. The proposed regulation would also allow schools to remove an individual accused of sexual harassment from an educational program or activity on an emergency basis, but only after conducting an individualized risk and safety analysis and providing the accused with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision. The proposed regulation would also significantly alter the ultimate decisionmaking requirements for schools, requiring a quasi-judicial proceeding in the form of a live hearing for institutions of higher education. Overall, the report highlights the need for clarification and consistency in the legal standards and procedures surrounding Title IX, particularly in light of recent changes to ED's guidance and OCR's enforcement practices.\n"

      "Prediction: The National Science Foundation (NSF) relies on two programs to bring in rotators: the IPA program and the VSEE program. The IPA program allows NSF to enter into written agreements with rotators' home institutions for all IPA assignments, while the VSEE program appoints VSEE rotators as federal employees on a non-paid leave of absence from their home institutions. Rotators in both programs differ in key respects, including their employment status and compensation. NSF reimburses its cost-sharing amounts to home institutions, which continue to pay rotators' full salaries and benefits. NSF does not cap the salaries of IPA rotators, while VSEE rotators are federal employees and their salaries are capped at the federal maximum for the position they hold at NSF. Both IPA and VSEE rotators are eligible for certain other types of reimbursement. NSF uses rotators in executive and program director positions to perform day-to-day agency operations, including managing the agency's merit review process for determining which projects to fund. The agency has adopted three strategies to manage rotators' costs in fiscal year 2017, but it is too soon to determine the full results because these new strategies are being phased in for new IPA agreements only. NSF has not developed an agency-wide workforce strategy for using rotators, as its IPA program steering committee recommended. NSF has not fully evaluated or developed plans to evaluate both IPA and VSEE rotator program results in terms of progress toward NSF's human capital goals or programmatic results. The report recommends that NSF complete the development of an agency-wide workforce strategy for balancing the agency's use of IPA and VSEE rotators with permanent staff as part of NSF's current agency reform planning efforts or updates to its human capital operating plan. The report also recommends that NSF evaluate the contributions of the IPA and VSEE rotator programs toward NSF's human capital goals and the contributions the programs have made toward achieving programmatic results. NSF concurred with these recommendations and stated that implementation of the recommendations will enhance efforts to fulfill the agency's mission and strengthen its workforce. \n",

These include assisted housing programs, housing finance, and housing-related tax provisions. The report provides an overview of major issues and is not intended to provide detailed information or analysis. The report also includes references to more in-depth CRS reports on these issues where possible. The report discusses housing market conditions, including rising home prices, relatively low interest rates, and rising rental costs that have led to increased concerns about housing affordability for both prospective homebuyers and renters. The report also discusses the supply of homes on the market, which has been relatively low in recent years, and the impact of rising house prices on affordability for prospective homebuyers. The report highlights the importance of rental affordability and the shortage of lower-cost rental units that are both available and affordable to extremely low-income renter households. The report also discusses the potential for legislative housing finance reform, new leadership at FHFA, and certain issues that could affect Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's finances and mortgage standards, respectively. The report notes that the Trump Administration's budget request for FY2020 proposes an 18% decrease in funding for HUD's programs and activities as compared to the prior year, and proposes to eliminate funding for several programs, including multiple HUD grant programs. The report also notes that several pieces of assisted housing legislation that were enacted in prior Congresses are expected to be implemented during the 116th Congress.

      "Prediction: The U.S. corporate income tax system is based on worldwide economic activity, which creates complications for tax administration and compliance. Corporations may choose where and how to organize to reduce their U.S. and worldwide tax liabilities, leading to strategies such as expatriation, inversions, and mergers. The report examines how Congress and the Department of the Treasury have reduced the benefits of inversions, and concludes with an examination of remaining methods for inverting and policy options available to prevent or limit these inversions. The report also discusses the history of proposals to limit inversions, both legislative and administrative, and the challenges of lowering the corporate tax rate further. The report suggests that adopting a territorial tax system without significant anti-abuse provisions could be problematic, as it would likely increase profit shifting abroad by U.S. firms. The report recommends expanding the scope of Section 7874, recognizing accumulated deferred earnings as currently taxable, and strengthening and modernizing the effectively connected income rules. The report also suggests monitoring the creation of non-U.S. subsidiaries owned by the foreign parent after inversion, and ensuring that assets transferred from the U.S. firm are transferred at arm's-length prices. The report concludes that while the substantial business avenue appears to have been largely eliminated by Treasury regulations, the option of merging with a smaller foreign company remains, and U.S. firms may also merge with larger firms, although in this case the tax benefits are less likely to be key factors in the decision to merge.\n"

The report identifies factors that affect cost differences and stakeholder views on the relative strengths of UN and U.S. peacekeeping operations. The report found that the estimated cost of a U.S. operation in CAR far exceeds U.S. contributions to MINUSCA. The report also identified disparities in the cost of sourcing and transporting equipment and supplies, staffing and compensating military and police personnel, and maintaining facilities and communications and intelligence systems as factors that contribute to the differences in costs between actual UN expenditures for MINUSCA and a hypothetical, comparable U.S. operation. The report also identified the relative strengths of UN peacekeeping operations, including international and local acceptance, access to global expertise, and the ability to leverage assistance from multilateral donors and development banks. The report also identified the relative strengths of U.S. peacekeeping operations, including faster deployment and superior command and control, logistics, intelligence, and counterterrorism capabilities. The report concludes that while UN peacekeeping operations provide indirect benefits to the military capacity of participating countries, U.S. peacekeeping operations have superior logistics systems and intelligence capabilities.\n"

The SBA's industry-specific size standards determine program eligibility for firms in 1,036 industrial classifications in 23 sub-industry activities described in the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The SBA's size standards methodology includes an assessment of various economic factors, such as each industry's overall competitiveness and the competitiveness of firms within each industry. The SBA's size standards have been challenged by industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and by Members of Congress concerned that the size standards may not adequately target federal assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. The SBA has reviewed its size standards piecemeal, reviewing specific industries when the SBA determined that an industry's market conditions had changed or the SBA was asked to undertake a review by an industry claiming that its market conditions had changed. The SBA completed its first five-year review of all SBA industry size standards in 2016, resulting in more than 72,000 small businesses gaining SBA eligibility. There is no uniform or accepted definition for a small business, and several criteria are used to determine eligibility for small business spending and tax programs. The SBA's size standards have been challenged by industry representatives seeking to increase the number of firms eligible for assistance and by Members of Congress concerned that the size standards may not adequately target federal assistance to firms that they consider to be truly small. The SBA's congressionally mandated requirement to conduct a detailed review of at least one-third of the SBA's industry size standards every 18 months was imposed by P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, to prevent small business size standards from becoming outdated. The SBA's economic analyses during the recent five-year review cycle often supported an increase in the size standards for many industries. However, the SBA's economic analyses also occasionally supported a decrease in the size standards for some industries. Despite the SBA's decision to, in most circumstances, make no changes when their economic analyses indicated that a decrease was warranted, it could be argued that the increased frequency of the reviews has generally prevented the SBA's size standards from becoming\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the incidence and amount of early withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRA) and 401(k) plans, as well as the factors that lead individuals to access their retirement savings early. The report also identifies potential strategies or policies that could reduce the incidence and amount of early withdrawals. The report finds that over the last three decades, employers have shifted away from sponsoring defined benefit plans and towards DC plans, which transfer investment risk from employers to employee participants. The report notes that early withdrawals of retirement savings can have short-term and long-term impacts on participants' ability to accumulate retirement savings. The report also notes that employers have implemented plan policies that seek to balance the short-term benefits of providing participants early access to their accounts with the long-term need to build retirement savings. However, the way plan sponsors treat outstanding loans after a participant separates from employment has the potential to adversely affect retirement savings. The report recommends that the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary for EBSA, in coordination with IRS, to revise the Form 5500 to require plan sponsors to report qualified plan loan offsets as a separate line item distinct from other types of distributions. The report also identifies several strategies that could reduce early withdrawals from retirement savings, including raising the age at which the additional 10 percent tax applies, allowing individuals to roll existing plan loans into an IRA, allowing IRA loans, simplifying the rollover process, restricting cashouts to participant contributions only, narrowing the IRS safe harbor, and replacing hardship withdrawals with hardship loans. The report notes that any of these proposed strategies, if implemented, could increase the costs of administering IRAs and plans, require changes to federal law or regulations, and involve trade-offs between providing access to retirement savings and preserving savings for retirement.\n"

      "Prediction: Georgia is a country located in the South Caucasus region between the Black and Caspian Seas. It was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the early 19th century and gained independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Georgia has unresolved conflicts with two Russian-supported regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are home to ethnic groups that more closely identify with ethnic kin in Russia's North Caucasus. The country has a parliamentary system of governance and a unicameral legislature with 150 members elected for four-year terms. The ruling party, Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia, has exhibited signs of internal tension and has had tense relations with the presidency. The government also has had disputes over judicial reforms and the appointment of judges. Georgia has been recovering from the severe economic decline it experienced after the Soviet Union collapsed and remains a relatively poor country. Its economy depends in part on remittances from labor migration, and it has suffered in the past from energy shortages and gas cutoffs. Georgia has aspired to be a key transit hub for the growing East-West overland trade route between China and Europe. The country has close relations with NATO, which considers Georgia one of its \"closest operational partners.\" However, many observers consider that closer integration with the EU and NATO has not enabled Georgia to improve its near-term prospects for membership in these organizations. The United States and Georgia have deepened their strategic partnership since Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia and 2014 invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. government has expressed support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and has provided substantial amounts of foreign and military aid to the country. The U.S. and Georgia have held annual joint military exercises in Georgia since 2011. The United States and Georgia have discussed the possibility of a free-trade agreement since 2012. Overall, Georgia faces challenges related to its unresolved conflicts, economic recovery, and integration with the EU and NATO.\n"

It also highlights the importance of specialized care for patients with catastrophic spinal cord injuries, acquired brain injuries, or other paralyzing neuromuscular conditions. The report notes that Medicare payment policies may impact the availability of specialized services for these patients, as LTCHs are subject to site-neutral payment policies that may decrease payments for certain discharges. The report also notes that IRFs may provide similar specialized care, but the availability of certain services may vary by facility. The report concludes by emphasizing the need for future comparison of beneficiaries, costs of services, and outcomes of care across different settings, which may be made possible by efforts such as the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014.

      "Prediction: The DEA is responsible for ensuring the availability of controlled substances for legitimate uses while preventing their diversion through its administration and enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations. The Disposal Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to deliver unused controlled substances to an entity authorized by DEA to dispose of the substances. DEA regulates entities that manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances to limit diversion and prevent abuse. As of April 2017, about 3 percent of pharmacies and other eligible entities had chosen to become DEA-authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. Participation rates varied by state, though in most states relatively few of the eligible entities had registered with DEA to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. The availability of nearby disposal bins varied significantly for people depending on whether they lived in an urban or a rural area. Costs, uncertainty, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs were factors that explained why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities had chosen to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. DEA officials told us that addressing cost issues with eligible participants falls outside of their responsibilities. DEA officials responded to questions about whether a specific method of destruction meets the non-retrievable standard by telling the registrant to test the remnants after destruction, to see if any components of the controlled substance are still present.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the House of Representatives' standing rules for considering bills and resolutions on the floor. It explains how the House may temporarily set aside these rules for measures that are not otherwise privileged for consideration, such as through a special order of business resolution or by adopting a motion to suspend the rules and pass the underlying measure. The report also describes the suspension procedure, which is defined in clause 1 of House Rule XV, and provides an analysis of measures considered under suspension during the 114th Congress. The report explains that most bills and resolutions that receive floor action in the House are called up and considered under suspension of the rules. The suspension procedure allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without a special rule, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. The report also discusses the prevalence and form of suspension measures, sponsors of measures, committee consideration, length of floor debate, voting, and resolution of differences between the chambers. The report concludes that suspension measures are limited to a maximum of 40 minutes of debate under Rule XV, but on most suspension measures, only a fraction of that time was actually expended during consideration. The report also notes that while suspension measures generally receive broad support, measures that receive the requisite two-thirds majority in the House are not guaranteed passage in the Senate. Overall, the report provides a comprehensive analysis of the suspension procedure and its use in the House of Representatives during the 114th Congress.\n"

      "Prediction: The National Cemeteries Act of 1973 created the modern veterans’ cemetery system, which is managed by the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). NCA maintains existing national cemeteries and builds new ones for veterans and their family members. Since 1978, NCA has provided funding through VA’s Veterans Cemetery Grants Program (Grants Program) to help establish, expand, or improve state and tribal veterans’ cemeteries. States and tribal governments seeking funding from the Grants Program must apply to the VA. Any cemetery established, expanded, or improved through funding from VA’s Grants Program must be maintained and operated in accordance with NCA’s operational standards. Veterans from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and some U.S. territories are served by national, state, or tribal cemeteries. NCA’s methodology uses a veteran’s county of residence as a proxy for being within 75 miles of a veterans’ cemetery. NCA’s plan entails establishing 18 new national cemeteries—comprised of five traditional national cemeteries and 13 urban and rural initiative national cemeteries—and awarding funds for new state veterans’ cemeteries. In 2014, NCA estimated approximately 90 percent of the veteran population had reasonable access to burial options, and that it expected to reach its strategic goal of providing reasonable access to 96 percent of veterans by the end of fiscal year 2017. Since 2014, NCA has revised its strategic goal to provide reasonable access to 95 percent of the veteran population, and NCA’s current long-range plan to achieve this goal covers fiscal years 2018-2022. NCA’s 2014 plan to increase veterans’ access to burial options included building 18 new national cemeteries as follows: Five traditional national cemeteries, to be located in Western New York; Central East Florida; Southern Colorado; Tallahassee, Florida; and Omaha, Nebraska. Taken together, according to NCA, these cemeteries are intended to provide a burial option to an additional 550,000 veterans and their families. Five urban initiative cemeteries, to be located in Los Angeles, California; the San Francisco Bay Area, California; Chicago, Illinois; Indianapolis, Indiana; and New York, New York. Taken together, according to NCA, the urban initiative is intended to expand burial options for approximately 2.\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the effectiveness of the Section 130 Program, which provides federal funding for grade-crossing safety improvement projects. The program has been successful in reducing grade-crossing crashes and fatalities since 1975, but the number of crashes and fatalities has plateaued since 2009. The program requires states to spend at least 50% of funds on protective devices, such as warning lights and gates, which have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of a crash. However, the program's requirements may impede innovative approaches and make it difficult to measure the effectiveness of specific projects. The report recommends that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) evaluate the program's requirements to determine whether they allow states sufficient flexibility to adequately address current and emerging grade-crossing safety issues. The report also notes that education and enforcement efforts are crucial to further improving safety, but the program's requirements do not allow for the use of funds for these types of projects. The report suggests that a comprehensive evaluation of the program could help improve program effectiveness and enable the program to better keep up with the rapid pace of technological change. The report recommends that FHWA work with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to evaluate potential changes to improve the effectiveness of the Section 130 Program. The report also notes that FRA's new grade-crossing inspectors are well-positioned to help FHWA evaluate potential changes to improve the effectiveness of the program.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the growing interest in using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a maritime fuel due to the combination of increasing supplies of LNG and new requirements for less polluting fuels in the international maritime shipping industry. The report highlights the potential benefits of using LNG as a primary fuel, including reducing harmful air emissions, creating a new market for domestic natural gas, and creating economic opportunities in domestic shipbuilding. However, the report also notes that U.S. ports would need specialized vessels and land-based infrastructure for LNG \"bunkering\" (vessel refueling) as well as appropriate regulatory oversight of the associated shipping and fueling operations. The report also discusses the safety implications of using LNG in shipping, including the potential for leaks and spills, which could pose serious hazards. The report notes that the IMO 2020 emissions requirement applies to vessels of 400 gross tons and over, which is estimated to cover about 110,000 vessels worldwide. Ship owners have two main options for meeting the emission requirements with existing engines: burn low-sulfur conventional fuel (or biofuels) or install scrubbers to clean their exhaust gases. Alternatively, ship owners may opt to install new LNG-fueled engines to comply with the IMO standard. The report also notes that the rate of scrubber adoption could affect the financial impacts of installing them in terms of fuel costs. The report concludes that while using LNG as a fuel has the potential to reduce emissions and create economic opportunities, it also poses challenges, including rising demand for LNG in the maritime sector, which could increase natural gas prices for domestic consumers, and the potential for increased emissions from increased natural gas production and transportation. The report suggests that Congress could encourage the growth of LNG bunkering by providing tax incentives to support the construction of LNG bunkering facilities and vessels, addressing any statutory or regulatory barriers to bunkering facility siting or operations, and providing funding for technical support to domestic carriers seeking to adopt LNG technology. Alternatively, Congress could also affect growth in LNG bunkering through policies affecting the LNG industry or domestic shipping industry as a whole.\n"

It also looks at the extent to which states require or support testing for and remediating lead in school drinking water by school districts, and the extent to which federal agencies are supporting state and school district efforts to test for and remediate lead. The report finds that while some states and school districts have decided to test for lead in the drinking water to help protect students, many districts have still not been tested. Even in states and school districts that have opted to test, officials may choose different action levels to identify elevated lead and may choose different testing protocols that do not test all fixtures in all schools. EPA has developed helpful guidance—3Ts—and webinars for states and school districts to support efforts to test and remediate lead in school drinking water. However, some EPA regional offices have not communicated the importance of testing for and remediating lead to states and school districts. By promoting further efforts to communicate the importance of lead testing to school districts to help ensure that their lead testing programs are in line with good practices, including the 3Ts guidance, regional offices that have not focused on this issue could build on the recent efforts of other regional offices to provide technical assistance and guidance and other forms of support. State and school district officials can use EPA’s 3Ts guidance to help ensure that their drinking water testing and remediation efforts are in line with good practices and said that it has been helpful for establishing their programs. However, statements in the guidance—which has not been updated in over a decade—that suggest the action level described will ensure that school facilities do not have elevated lead in their drinking water are misleading. In addition, state and school district officials told us that additional guidance—including information on a recommended schedule for retesting as well as on costs associated with testing and remediation—could help school districts make more informed decisions regarding their testing and remediation efforts. Without providing interim or updated guidance, EPA is providing schools with confusing and out of date information, which can increase the risk of school districts making uninformed decisions. EPA officials said they would consider updates to the 3Ts action level while the revisions to the LCR are being completed. However, the longer school districts are without the additional information they need to conduct their efforts in line with good practices and continue to rely on confusing and misleading information, the more challenges they will face in trying to limit children’s exposure to lead. After EPA revises the LCR, the\n"

      "Prediction: The Department of Defense (DOD) spends over $300 billion annually on goods and services, including research and development. Most of these acquisitions are governed by numerous statutes and regulations found in Title 10 of the United States Code, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). However, DOD can also enter into certain transactions without triggering most of the standard acquisition statutes and regulations by using other transaction (OT) authorities. Congress has expanded these authorities and DOD is increasingly using OTs for research, prototyping, and production. This report examines how OTs work, why they were established, potential benefits and risks of using OTs, and whether there are data available against which to measure their effectiveness. OTs are legally binding contracts that are generally exempt from federal procurement laws and regulations such as the Competition in Contracting Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. They can be used for three purposes: conducting research, developing prototypes, or contracting for follow-on production of a successful prototype project. OTs can only be used for prototypes if one of the following applies: at least one nontraditional defense contractor significantly participating in the project; all significant participants are small businesses or nontraditional defense contractors; at least one-third of the total cost of the prototype project is provided by nongovernment participants; or the senior procurement acquisition official provides in writing an explanation of the exceptional circumstances justifying an OT. Follow-on production can only be conducted when the underlying prototype OT was competitively awarded, and the prototype project was successfully completed. OTs can be structured in numerous ways, including a direct relationship between a single government agency and a single provider; joint ventures; partnerships; multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers; or through a consortium. Some analysts argue that using consortia in this way gives the federal government a unique ability to leverage and pool the technological expertise and innovation of multiple entities in a particular sector, thereby strengthening and advancing a sector of the industrial base that may have defense applications. OTs are not procurement contracts and thus are exempt from numerous procurement statutes and regulations, including the statutes in Chapter 137 of Title 10 (Procurement Generally). They are, however, bound by standard contract and other select laws and regulations. OTs are not free from all legislative and regulatory requirements. Generally, statutes and regulations that are not procurement-specific apply, including the Trade Secrets Act, (18 U.S.C. 1905); the Economic Espionage Act (18 U.S.C. 1831-\n"

      "Prediction: The report examines the current legal landscape governing data protection in the United States, which is complex and highly technical. While some concern over data protection stems from how the government might utilize such data, mounting worries have centered on how the private sector controls digital information. The report highlights the inadequacy of corporate privacy practices and intentional intrusions into private computer networks that have exposed the personal information of millions of Americans. The report also discusses the growing number of \"consumer facing\" actors and \"behind the scenes\" actors that collect, maintain, and use consumers' information. The report notes that the protection of personal data has emerged as a major issue for congressional consideration. The report examines potential legal considerations for the 116th Congress should it consider crafting more comprehensive federal data protection legislation. The report also discusses the current patchwork of federal data protection laws, contrasting the current patchwork of federal data protection laws with the more comprehensive regulatory models in the CCPA and GDPR. The report lastly contains an Appendix, which contains a table summarizing the federal data protection laws discussed in the report. The report concludes that the legal paradigms governing the security and privacy of personal data are complex and technical, and lack uniformity at the federal level. The report suggests that while some state and foreign governments have enacted more comprehensive data protection legislation, the legal landscape coupled with concerns that existing federal laws are inadequate has led many stakeholders to argue that the federal government should assume a larger role in data protection policy. However, at present, there is no consensus as to what, if any, role the federal government should play, and any legislative efforts at data protection are likely to implicate unique legal concerns such as preemption, standing, and First Amendment rights, among other issues. \n",

      "Prediction: The report evaluates the reliability of the Census Bureau's life-cycle cost estimate for the 2020 Census. The report found that the Bureau's cost estimate partially met two of the four characteristics of a reliable cost estimate (comprehensive and accurate) and minimally met the other two (well-documented and credible). The report recommends that the Bureau take specific steps to ensure its cost estimate meets the characteristics of a high-quality estimate. The Bureau has made significant progress in addressing the recommendation, but the cost estimate still does not fully reflect characteristics of a high-quality estimate as described in the Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. The report also notes that an unreliable life-cycle cost estimate is one of the reasons why the 2020 Census was designated a GAO High-Risk Area in 2017. The report highlights the importance of a reliable cost estimate in supporting management decision-making and effective program development and oversight. The report recommends that the Bureau finalize its guidance, policies, and procedures for cost estimation in accordance with best practices. The report also notes that the Bureau has established reliable guidance, processes, and policies for developing cost estimates and managing the cost estimation process. Overall, the report emphasizes the need for the Bureau to continue to use the life-cycle cost estimate as a management tool to guide decision-making and support ongoing \"what-if\" analyses in determining the cost impacts of design decisions.\n"

The report also provides historical tables on the rate of pay for Members of Congress since 1789 and details on enacted legislation with language prohibiting the automatic annual pay adjustment since the most recent adjustment. The report notes that Members of Congress only receive salaries during the terms for which they are elected and may be eligible for retirement benefits following their service. The report also notes that there are three basic ways to adjust Member pay, including specific legislation, recommendations from the President based on those made by a quadrennial salary commission, and annual adjustments based on changes in private sector wages and salaries as measured by the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The report also notes that discussion of the Member pay adjustment sometimes occurs during consideration of annual appropriations bills, but these bills do not contain funds for the annual salaries or pay adjustment for Members. The report concludes by noting that legislation has been introduced in Congress to repeal the automatic pay adjustment provision, change the procedure by which pay for Members of Congress is adjusted or disbursed, reduce the pay of Members of Congress, prohibit pay for Members of Congress during a lapse in appropriations resulting in a government shutdown, and apply any sequester to Member pay.

      "Prediction: The Department of Defense (DOD) has policies and procedures in place to prevent and respond to unwanted sexual behaviors, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence involving sexual assault. However, some of these policies do not include key elements such as anonymous reporting of sexual harassment and principles in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework for sexual violence prevention. DOD has developed reliable data systems for collecting and reporting data on some of these unwanted sexual behaviors, including sexual assault and instances of domestic violence with sexual assault. However, inconsistencies in sexual harassment data elements and definitions may be creating difficulties in developing department-wide reports on unwanted sexual behaviors. To improve and standardize data collection efforts, DOD should direct the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity to develop standard data elements and definitions for maintaining and reporting information on sexual harassment incidents at the military service level, and direct the military services to incorporate these data elements and definitions into their military service-specific databases. Additionally, DOD should incorporate elements of a long-term, results-oriented strategy into its overarching prevention strategy to ensure that the department is appropriately concentrating its efforts to prevent and respond to the full range of unwanted behaviors. The report recommends that the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness fully include in the new policy for sexual harassment the principles in the CDC's framework for sexual violence prevention, including risk and protective factors, risk domains, and tertiary strategies. The report also recommends that the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness include in the new policy for sexual harassment mechanisms for anonymous reporting of incidents consistent with section 579 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013. Finally, the report recommends that the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness to incorporate in its continuum of harm prevention strategy all the elements that are key for establishing a long-term, results-oriented strategic planning framework.\n"

      "Prediction: The report evaluates the effectiveness of the U.S. Secret Service's IT infrastructure and workforce management practices. The Secret Service has faced long-standing challenges in managing its IT infrastructure, including outdated systems and network vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, the Secret Service initiated the Information Integration and Technology Transformation (IITT) investment, which aims to modernize and enhance the component's infrastructure, communications systems, applications, and processes. The report also examines the Secret Service's workforce management practices, including strategic planning, recruitment and hiring, training and development, employee morale, and performance management. The report finds that the Secret Service has not fully implemented all of the selected practices for its IT workforce for any of the five areas. The report recommends that the Secret Service establish an IT acquisition review process, update its enterprise governance policy, develop a charter for its Executive Resources Board, include product quality and post-deployment user satisfaction metrics in the modular outcomes and target measures for monitoring agile projects, identify all required knowledge and skills for the IT workforce, regularly analyze the IT workforce to identify competency gaps, update its recruiting and hiring strategies and plans to address all IT competency and staffing gaps identified, develop and track metrics to monitor the effectiveness of the recruitment program and hiring process, adjust recruitment plans and hiring activities based on recruitment and hiring effectiveness metrics, define the required training for each IT workforce group, ensure that staff take required training, collect and assess performance data regarding the training program, update the performance plans for each occupational series within the IT workforce to include the relevant technical competencies, and collect and assess performance data (including qualitative or quantitative measures, as appropriate) to determine how the IT training program contributes to improved performance and results. The report also recommends that the Secret Service monitor program performance and conduct reviews at predetermined checkpoints or milestones for one program and three projects within the IITT investment, and measure and monitor agile projects on velocity, development progression, product quality, and post-deployment user satisfaction. Overall, the report suggests that the Secret Service needs to improve its IT infrastructure and workforce management practices to ensure timely and effective acquisition and maintenance of its IT infrastructure and services.\n"

It suggests that implicit bias on the part of teachers and staff may cause them to judge students' behaviors differently based on their race and sex. The report also notes that certain groups of students are more harshly disciplined than others, and that the types of offenses that Black children were disciplined for were largely based on school officials' interpretations of behavior. The report highlights the need for schools to address discipline disparities and discrimination, and provides examples of alternative discipline models that emphasize preventing challenging student behavior and focus on supporting individuals and the school community. The report also notes that changes to state law have been made or considered related to school discipline in the past several years, and that some states plan to include school discipline or absenteeism as measures of school quality in their state ESSA Title I plans.

Four federal agencies, the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Forest Service, administer about 95% of these lands. Congress has provided various acquisition and disposal authorities through laws enacted over more than a century. The extent to which each agency has authority to acquire and dispose of land varies considerably. The Bureau of Land Management has relatively broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals, while the National Park Service has no general authority to acquire land to create new park units or to dispose of park lands.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the legislative process in the House of Representatives, including the rules, precedents, and practices that govern it. The report explains that while the House has a complicated body of rules, precedents, and practices, there are two reasons why gaining a fundamental understanding of the House's legislative procedures is not as difficult as it might seem. First, the ways in which the House applies its rules are largely predictable, and second, underlying most of the rules is the principle that a majority of Members should ultimately be able to work their will on the floor. The report also explains that the House limits the opportunities for each Representative to participate in floor deliberations, and that debate on the floor must be germane to whatever legislative business the House is conducting. The report discusses the different modes of consideration that the House uses, including suspension of the rules, which enables it to act quickly on bills that enjoy overwhelming but not unanimous support. The report also explains that most major bills are not considered in the House under the hour rule, but instead are debated and amended in Committee of the Whole. The report concludes by discussing the process of resolving differences between the House and Senate, including the use of conference committees and special rules reported by the Rules Committee. The report provides a summary of the House's procedures and offers resources for further information.\n"

      "Prediction: The report addresses frequently asked questions related to the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for executive, administrative, and professional employees (the \"EAP\" or \"white collar\" exemptions). The report provides an overview of the main federal statute on overtime pay—the FLSA—and of defining and delimiting the EAP exemptions. The report discusses the applicability of the EAP exemptions, including the duties test, salary basis test, and salary level test. The report also provides information on the EAP exemptions in the 2019 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule (which was finalized but invalidated before it took effect). The report notes that there is no general exemption for nonprofits in the FLSA or the EAP overtime regulations, and that the FLSA and the EAP overtime regulations apply to institutions of higher education (IHEs). The report also notes that there is no blanket exemption from FLSA and overtime rule coverage for state and local governments. The report provides an overview of the main provisions of the 2019 proposed rule on EAP exemptions, including an increase in the salary level test from the current $455 per week ($23,660 annually) to $679 per week ($35,308 annually), an increase in the annual salary threshold for the HCE exemption from $100,000 to $147,414, and an allowance that up to 10% of the standard salary level may be comprised of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions. The report estimates that approximately 4.9 million workers would be affected by the proposed rule, with about 1.3 million EAP employees becoming newly entitled to overtime pay due to the increase in the salary threshold and an additional 3.6 million salaried workers receiving \"strengthened\" overtime protections. Overall, the report provides a comprehensive overview of the EAP exemptions and their implications for employers and employees.\n"

      "Prediction: The Trump Administration submitted a FY2019 budget request for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) that included $41.86 billion in base funds. The request represented a 23.3% decrease in SFOPS funding compared to the FY2018 actual funding level. The proposed State and related agency funding would have been 18.7% below FY2018 funding levels, and the foreign operations funding would have been reduced by 25.2%. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) included a total of $54.377 billion for SFOPS accounts, a 0.3% decrease over the FY2018 funding level and about 30% more than the Administration's request. The State Department sought to cut funding for the Department of State and Related Agency category by 19% in FY2019 from FY2018 funding levels, to $13.26 billion. The House and Senate committee bills sought to maintain funding near previous fiscal year levels. The FY2019 enacted appropriation (P.L. 116-6) maintained funding for the State Department and Related Agency category slightly above FY2018 funding level. The State Department's request sought to fund the entirety of this category through base (or enduring) funding. The State Department's proposed cuts were focused on the diplomatic security accounts, Contributions to International Organizations, and Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities. The enacted legislation provided a total of $54.38 billion in total SFOPS funding, a 0.3% decrease from the FY2018 funding level and about 30% more than the Administration's request. The State Department's request sought to provide approximately $5.36 billion for the department's key embassy security accounts: $3.70 billion for the Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) programmatic allocation within the Diplomatic Programs account and $1.66 billion for the Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM) account. The House committee bill would have provided $3.76 billion for WSP and $2.31 billion for ESCM, for a total funding level of $6.07 billion for these accounts. The Senate committee bill would have provided $3.82 billion for WSP and $1.92 billion for ESCM, for a total funding level of $5.74 billion.

      "Prediction: The report examines the persistent vacancies in the Department of State's Foreign Service staffing at overseas posts. The report found that as of March 31, 2018, 13 percent of State's overseas Foreign Service positions were vacant, with specialist positions remaining vacant at a higher rate. The report also found that vacancies in Foreign Service generalist positions responsible for analysis, engagement, and reporting at overseas posts limit the amount of reporting on political and economic developments that posts are able to submit back to State headquarters. Vacancies in the political and economic career tracks at overseas posts could adversely affect State's ability to achieve two of the goals in State and USAID's joint strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. The report also found that vacancies in Foreign Service specialist positions at overseas posts may heighten the level of security risk at the posts and disrupt post operations. The report recommends that the Secretary of State develop an integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts and provides suggested corrective measures to reduce such vacancies, including steps necessary to implement solutions. The report notes that while State has made some efforts to address Foreign Service vacancies, addressing chronic vacancies in critical positions at overseas posts requires a thoughtful, coherent, and integrated action plan that defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at overseas posts along with suggested corrective measures to reduce such vacancies, following what was called for in our 2017 High-Risk Series report. Developing such an action plan would help State address its persistent staffing gaps, improve its ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals, and help ensure secure and efficient operations.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the changing oil and petroleum markets since the establishment of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and how the United States has become a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products. The SPR is owned by the federal government and managed by the Department of Energy's Office of Petroleum Reserves. The SPR stores crude oil in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas, and it currently maintains four storage sites with a design capacity of 713.5 million barrels. The SPR has been used to respond to domestic supply disruptions, but it is limited in its ability to respond to disruptions that affect the refining sector. The report recommends that the Secretary of Energy supplement the agency's 2016 long-term strategic review by conducting an additional analysis that takes into account private sector response, oil market projections, and costs and benefits of a wide range of different SPR sizes. The report also recommends that the Secretary of Energy take actions to ensure that the agency periodically conducts and provides to Congress a strategic review of the SPR that takes into account changes in crude oil and petroleum product market conditions and contains additional analysis, such as the costs and benefits of a wide range of different SPR sizes. The report suggests that Congress may wish to consider setting a long-range target for the size and configuration of the SPR that takes into account projections for future oil production, oil consumption, the efficacy of the existing SPR to respond to domestic supply disruptions, and U.S. IEA obligations. Finally, the report recommends that the Secretary of Energy conduct or complete studies on the costs and benefits of regional petroleum product reserves for all U.S. regions that have been identified as vulnerable to fuel supply disruptions, and the Secretary should report the results to Congress.\n"

      "Prediction: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been using the legacy Medical Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) program for over a decade to order medical supplies, but it has limited standardization, which has affected its ability to leverage its buying power to achieve greater cost avoidance. To address this issue, VA transitioned to a new iteration called MSPV-NG, which aims to standardize requirements for supply items for greater clinical consistency, demonstrate cost avoidance by leveraging VA's substantial buying power when making competitive awards, achieve greater efficiency in ordering and supply chain management, and involve clinicians in requirements development to ensure uniform clinical review of medical supplies. However, VA's implementation of the MSPV-NG program has not been executed in line with leading practices. VA lacked a documented program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity for the transition, which made it difficult to execute the program within the planned time frames. VA also faced challenges in its initial requirements development process and tight time frames, which contributed to ineffective contracting processes. As a result, VA developed an initial formulary that did not meet the needs of the medical centers and has yet to achieve utilization and cost avoidance goals. VA made some changes in the second phase of requirements development to address deficiencies identified in the initial roll out, but the agency continues to face challenges that prevent the program from fully achieving its goals. VA did not document a clear overall strategy for the MSPV-NG program at the start and has not done so to date. The MSPV-NG program office initially developed requirements for items to be included in the formulary based almost exclusively on prior supply purchases, with limited clinician involvement. The program office concluded in its October 2015 formulary plan that relying on data from previous clinician purchases would be a good representation of medical centers' needs and that clinician input would not be required for identifying which items to include in the initial formulary. VA's goals for the MSPV-NG program include standardizing requirements for supply items for greater clinical consistency, demonstrating cost avoidance by leveraging VA's substantial buying power when making competitive awards, achieving greater efficiency in ordering and supply chain management, and involving clinicians in requirements development to ensure uniform clinical review of medical supplies.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the history and current practices of the US Navy in naming its ships. The Secretary of the Navy has the authority to name new Navy ships, and the naming process involves considering various sources such as historical significance, geographic locations, and suggestions from the public. The report notes that there are no set rules for naming ships, but there are general guidelines for certain types of ships. For example, attack submarines are named for states, while aircraft carriers are generally named for past US Presidents. The report also notes that there have been exceptions to these rules, such as naming ships for living individuals or for specific events. The report concludes that the Navy's ship-naming policies and practices are consistent with historical practices and traditions, and that establishing fixed policies for naming ships would be inadvisable. The report also suggests that the Naval History and Heritage Command will publish a list of current type naming rules to help the public better understand the naming process. Overall, the report provides insight into the complex and nuanced process of naming US Navy ships.\n"

      "Prediction: The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment concluded that global climate change is already affecting the United States and will intensify in the future. However, the severity of future impacts depends on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changes. While efforts to reduce emissions are underway, federal policymakers and stakeholders have different views on what to do about climate change. Some argue that climate change poses a direct threat to human society and that nations must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dire effects. Others question whether there are sufficient risks of climate change to merit a federal program requiring emissions reductions. If Congress were to consider establishing a program to reduce emissions, one option would be to apply a tax or fee on greenhouse gas emissions or the inputs that produce them. This report focuses on the policy considerations and potential impacts of using a carbon tax or greenhouse gas emissions fee to control emissions. The report examines carbon tax design issues, including the point of taxation, the rate of taxation, and potential border carbon adjustments. It also discusses issues related to the distribution of carbon tax revenues and additional considerations associated with a carbon tax program, including estimates of greenhouse gas emissions, federal revenue, and fossil fuel prices and changes in energy use. The report concludes that policymakers would face challenging decisions regarding the distribution of carbon tax revenues, including minimizing economy-wide costs, lessening the costs borne by specific groups, and supporting a range of specific policy objectives. A primary concern with a carbon tax is the potential economy-wide costs that may result. The report also notes that a carbon tax is projected to disproportionately impact fossil fuel industries and the communities that rely on their employment, and policymakers could allocate some of the carbon tax revenue to provide transition assistance to employees or affected communities. Overall, the report highlights the need for policymakers to carefully consider the potential impacts of a carbon tax program and to weigh the trade-offs among different objectives.\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits provided through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The report highlights that the funding requirements for these benefits changed in 2006, with USPS required to start fully \"prefunding\" retiree health benefits. However, USPS has missed approximately $38 billion in payments to the fund since fiscal year 2010, and the fund's balance is declining. The report identifies eight potential policy approaches to address the financial sustainability of postal retiree health benefits, including Medicare integration, supplemental federal appropriations, tightening eligibility or reducing retiree health benefits, increasing premium payments by postal retirees and/or postal employees, changing the federal contribution to a fixed subsidy, establishing a non-federal voluntary employees' beneficiary association (VEBA) for postal retiree health benefits, and reducing the required level of prefunding. The report concludes that all of these approaches have different potential effects, and it is up to Congress to consider the merits of the approaches and determine the most appropriate action to take. The report also notes that failure to address the poor financial outlook of the RHB Fund could pose serious consequences for postal retirees, USPS, postal customers, and other stakeholders, including the federal government. The report recommends that Congress should consider passing legislation to put postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing.\n"

The report also identifies recommended practices for addressing NAS, including prioritizing non-pharmacologic treatment, educating mothers on prenatal care, treatment for NAS, and resources for after an infant’s hospital discharge. The report recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expeditiously develop a plan to effectively implement the NAS-related recommendations identified in the Protecting Our Infants Act: Final Strategy.

      "- Health care providers predominantly diagnose NAS using the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool.\n",
      "- Non-pharmacologic treatment, such as placing the infant in a dark and quiet environment, swaddling, breastfeeding, rooming-in with the mother, and providing high-calorie nutrition, is recommended instead of pharmacologic treatment.\n",
      "- HHS has published several guidance and educational resources related to NAS and prenatal opioid use.\n",
      "- Medicaid pays for NAS treatment services provided in non-hospital settings, but generally pays for these services separately, in contrast with the single bundled payment paid to hospitals.\n",

The report highlights the importance of balancing the need for privacy with the need for companies to collect and use consumer data to provide services and innovate. The report also notes that there are limitations in the current Internet privacy oversight approach, including the reliance on FTC's unfair and deceptive practices authority to address Internet privacy issues. The report suggests that a comprehensive federal privacy statute with specific standards could enhance the federal government's ability to protect consumer privacy, provide more certainty in the marketplace, and provide better assurance to consumers that their privacy will be protected. The report recommends that Congress consider developing comprehensive legislation on Internet privacy that would enhance consumer protections and provide flexibility to address a rapidly evolving Internet environment. The report also notes that there are opportunities for enhancing Internet privacy oversight, including the enactment of an overarching federal privacy statute, APA section 553 notice-and-comment rulemaking authority, and civil penalty authority for any violation of a statutory or regulatory requirement.

The FBI's mission and workforce have expanded since September 11, 2001, and the Hoover Building is not designed to meet the needs of today's FBI. The building's original design is inefficient, making it difficult to reconfigure space to promote staff collaboration. The condition of the Hoover Building is deteriorating, and GSA assessments have identified significant recapitalization needs. The FBI operates in annexes, which create security challenges, particularly for annexes located in multitenant buildings. The FBI also occupies space leased from foreign owners in at least six different locations, which could present security risks. The report also discusses alternative funding mechanisms for federal real property projects, including swap exchanges and budgetary options within the current unified budget structure. The report recommends that GSA develop criteria for determining when to solicit market interest in a swap exchange and that project decisions should reflect both the likely risk and the organization's tolerance for risk. The report also notes that alternative budgetary structures may change budgetary incentives for agencies and therefore help Congress and agencies make more prudent long-term fiscal decisions.\n"

      "Prediction: The unemployment insurance (UI) system has two primary objectives: to provide temporary, partial wage replacement for involuntarily unemployed workers and to stabilize the economy during recessions. The joint federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides up to 26 weeks of income support through regular UC benefit payments. The Extended Benefit (EB) program may extend receipt of unemployment benefits at the state level if certain economic conditions exist within the state. As of the date of this publication, although both the UC and EB programs are authorized, no state is in an active EB period. The Social Security Act of 1935 authorizes the joint federal-state UC program to provide unemployment benefits. Most states provide up to a maximum of 26 weeks of UC benefits. Former federal workers may be eligible for unemployment benefits through the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 provides that ex-servicemembers be treated the same as other unemployed workers with respect to benefit levels, the waiting period for benefits, and benefit duration. The UI program is financed by federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under each state's State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA). The President's budget for FY2020 proposes changes to several aspects of the UI system, including creating a new required standard for state account balances within the UTF and a new benefit entitlement for paid parental leave financed through state unemployment taxes. The President's budget proposal for FY2020 would require states to maintain a minimum level of solvency in their UTF account balances to be at least half (0.5) of the state's AHCM. The proposal would alter the rules for calculating the net FUTA rate, requiring a higher net FUTA rate on a state's employers if that state maintained an AHCM of less than 0.5 on January 1 of two or more consecutive years. The additional FUTA revenue would be deposited into the state UTF account and would be terminated once the state met the 0.5 AHCM criteria. The President's budget proposal for FY2020 would require states to establish a paid parental leave benefit by 2020, using the UC program as its base for an administrative framework. States would be required to provide six weeks of benefits to a worker on leave or otherwise absent from work for the birth or adoption of the worker's child. States would have discretion to determine the parameters of eligibility and financing for this new paid parental leave\n"

The report found that while most consumers in focus groups found the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov easy to use, some experienced difficulties completing tasks due to the website not always reflecting federal and industry key website usability practices. NHTSA has taken steps to improve its website, but it has not determined a completion date for its website consolidation effort, which is essential for organizations to effectively guide their information technology efforts. The report recommends that NHTSA determine a completion date for the agency’s website consolidation effort and take interim steps to improve the usability of the auto recall areas of NHTSA.gov while the consolidation effort is ongoing. The report also recommends that NHTSA evaluate the effectiveness of various notification means used by manufacturers by comparing completion rates across means, which could encourage consumers to complete repairs.

      "Prediction: The report discusses the use of cluster munitions in armed conflicts and their impact on civilians. Cluster munitions are weapons that disperse smaller submunitions over an area, making them valuable militarily because they can kill or destroy multiple targets with fewer weapons systems. However, they also pose a significant risk to civilians due to their imprecise nature and high failure rate. The report notes that many cluster munitions rely on simple mechanical fuzes that arm the submunition based on its rate of spin and explode on impact or after a time delay. The report also notes that some nations are developing \"smart\" or sensor-fuzed weapons with greater reliability and a variety of self-destruct mechanisms intended to address the residual hazard of submunitions. \n",
      "\n",
      "The report highlights the use of cluster munitions in various conflicts, including World War II, the Gulf War, and the Iraq War. The report also notes that the United States has not used cluster munitions since 2003, but the new DOD policy on cluster munitions potentially raises a number of issues for possible congressional consideration. The policy rescinds limits on cluster munition use after 2018, which could affect combatant commanders' operational plans in their respective theaters. The report also notes that DOD's emphasis on achieving a 1% or less unexploded submunitions standard \"as rapidly as industry can support\" may slow or stall programs previously intended to replace those systems that exceeded 1% because there no longer is an urgent operational need to replace those systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the report emphasizes the need for caution when using cluster munitions due to their potential harm to civilians. The report also notes that the development of \"smart\" or sensor-fuzed weapons with greater reliability and a variety of self-destruct mechanisms intended to address the residual hazard of submunitions could help mitigate this risk. However, the report also notes that even with advances in \"sensor-fuzed\" type submunitions that seek out and destroy certain targets, cluster munitions might be losing their military relevance in an era where precision weapons are increasingly becoming the military norm. \n",

The PA program provides funds to states, local governments, and private nonprofit organizations to repair damaged public infrastructure following a presidentially declared disaster. The report highlights the shortage of experienced and knowledgeable staff, high turnover, unclear organizational responsibilities, and inconsistent training, which have impaired PA program delivery and delayed recovery efforts. FEMA has implemented several changes to address these challenges, including hiring new managers for FEMA regional offices, stakeholder training on PA program administration, and using a newly developed internal website to allow staff to post and share information to address continuity and knowledge sharing concerns during disaster operations. The report also discusses the new delivery model for awarding PA program grants, which includes a new process to develop and review grant applications, new positions, such as a new program delivery manager who is the single point of contact throughout the grant application process, and a new information system to maintain and share PA grant application documents. The report recommends that FEMA complete a workforce staffing assessment to identify the appropriate number of staff needed at joint field offices, Consolidated Resource Centers, and in FIMA's hazard mitigation cadre to implement the new delivery model nationwide. The report also recommends that FEMA establish controls for tracking FAC-Trax capabilities to ensure the new information system meets users' needs, establish system testing criteria to assess FAC-Trax as it is developed, and develop performance measures and associated objectives for the new delivery model to better align with FEMA's strategic goals for hazard mitigation in the recovery process.

The Public Safety Officers' Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program, a component of the PSOB program, provides higher-education assistance to the children and spouses of public safety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. Both programs are administered by the PSOB Office of the Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The PSOB and PSOEA benefit amounts are indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living. To be eligible for PSOB benefits for death or disability, a person must have served in one of the following categories of public safety officers: law enforcement officer, firefighter, or chaplain in a public agency; FEMA employee or a state, local, or tribal emergency management agency employee; or emergency medical services member. PSOB death and disability benefits are paid in addition to any other workers' compensation, life insurance, or other benefits paid for the death of a public safety officer. PSOB death benefits are payable to eligible survivors in the following order: spouse, children, parents, or surviving adult, nondependent, children of the officer. PSOB disability benefits are paid only in cases of permanent and total disability. PSOEA benefits are payable to the claimant and may be used only to defray costs associated with higher education attendance, including tuition, room, board, book and supplies, and education-related fees. The monthly PSOEA benefit amount is equal to the monthly benefit amount payable under the GI Bill Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program, which is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for spouses and dependents of veterans with disabilities or who died as a result of service-connected conditions. A claimant who is dissatisfied with a PSOB disability benefit denial may request a reconsideration. The PSOB Office director's determination is considered the final agency determination and is not subject to any further agency administrative review or appeal. The PSOB statute authorizes the BJA to prescribe the maximum fee that an attorney or other representative may charge a claimant for services rendered in connection with a claim, with attorney fees generally limited to between 3% and 6% of the total benefit paid, depending on the level in the administrative appeals\n"

      "Prediction: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for leading national efforts to detect, respond to, and prevent illnesses and injuries that result from natural causes or the release of biological, chemical, or radiological agents. The agency relies on an array of partners, including public health associations and state and local public health agencies. CDC uses its staff located in foreign countries to aid in international efforts, such as guarding against global diseases. The agency's total appropriation for fiscal year 2017 was approximately $12 billion, of which it reported spending approximately $424 million on information technology. CDC relies extensively on information technology to fulfill its mission and support related administrative needs. The agency's chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for establishing and enforcing policies and procedures protecting information resources. The CIO is to lead the efforts to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support the agency and its operations, and is to report quarterly to the HHS CIO on the overall effectiveness of CDC's information security and privacy program, including the progress of remedial actions. The CIO designated a chief information security officer (CISO), who is to oversee compliance with applicable information security and privacy requirements of the agency. The CISO, among other things, is responsible for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and disruption of information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency. To further ensure information security compliance, information systems security officers (ISSO) are responsible for managing the information security program within their respective organizations and report on security program matters to the CISO, including computer security-related incidents. ISSO responsibilities include ensuring that vendor-issued security patches are expeditiously installed and that system owners establish processes for timely removal of access privileges when a user's system access is no longer necessary. In addition, security stewards serve as program managers, accepting full accountability for the operations of the systems and ensuring that security is planned, documented, and properly resourced for each aspect of the information security program. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets. FISMA assigns responsibility to the head of each agency for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information systems used or operated by an\n"

      "Prediction: The report discusses the ongoing conflict in Yemen and the role of the United States in supporting the Saudi-led coalition's military operations. The report highlights the growing concern among lawmakers about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Yemen and the need for improved aid access. The report also notes that some lawmakers view the conflict through a regional lens, seeing it as a proxy war between Iran-backed Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition. The report notes that the Trump Administration has signaled strong support for the Saudi-led coalition's operations in Yemen as a bulwark against Iranian regional interference. The report also notes that the pace and scale of fighting on the ground increased dramatically by the summer of 2018, and that the prospect of widespread famine in Yemen coupled with international reprobation over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi pressured the Administration and the coalition to accelerate moves toward peace talks. The report concludes by noting that the 116th Congress may continue to debate U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition and Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war in Yemen, and that Congress may grapple with questions about the conduct of U.S. diplomacy, the provision of U.S. security support, and the investment of U.S. assistance and defense funds for years to come. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the report suggests that the conflict in Yemen is a complex issue with multiple stakeholders and competing interests. While some lawmakers express opposition to the intervention and U.S. involvement on moral grounds, others argue that the conflict's continuation creates opportunities for Iran and Sunni Islamist extremist groups to expand their influence and operations in Yemen. The report also notes that the balance of votes shifted in favor of measures that could be described as critical or restrictive of U.S. support for Saudi-led coalition operations with regard to arms sales, oversight measures, and war powers measures. However, it remains difficult to identify the locus of congressional consensus about Yemen. \n",

      "Prediction: The Occupy movement continues to make headlines across the country. In Philadelphia, about 100 protesters sat down on the concrete of Dilworth Plaza, waiting to be evicted for violating a deadline set by Mayor Nutter. However, the expected police eviction did not happen by late Sunday evening, and city officials continued to avoid saying when or whether they would throw the Occupiers and their tents off City Hall's front lawn. The protesters served squash soup in paper cups, handed out bottles of water, and railed against what they believe is excessive corporate greed and power. Police had no plans to evict anyone, and Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan cautioned that protesters would be prevented from setting up another camp elsewhere in the city unless they got a permit. \n",

      "In Los Angeles, the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered Occupy L.A. protesters to immediately disperse or face arrest. Police officers carrying batons, plastic handcuffs, and non-lethal weapons lined up on 1st Street directly outside LAPD headquarters in anticipation of possible arrests of protesters who were standing in the streets. The dispersal order came nearly four hours after the midnight Sunday deadline for protesters to clear the lawn at City Hall, where Occupy L.A. protesters had camped out for two months. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks even as other cities moved in to clear out similar camps, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system. Villaraigosa eventually gave protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal, setting the stage for the latest showdown between leaders of a major U.S. city and the Occupy movement. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak. Police Commander Andrew Smith later said he thought it was \"highly unlikely\" that the camp would be forced to shut down on Monday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere in the country, a 5 p.m. Sunday deadline set by Philadelphia officials for Occupy protesters there to move from a similar encampment came and went without incident.

Police sources said authorities were hoping the rest of the protesters would relocate voluntarily and that no major actions were expected before Tuesday. \n",

      "Prediction: Mikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47 assault rifle, expressed his guilt over the many deaths caused by his weapon in a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church shortly before his death. Kalashnikov, who died in December at the age of 94, wrote a lengthy emotional letter to Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill in April, Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, reported on Monday. In the letter, Kalashnikov said that he first went into a church at the age of 91 and was later baptised. The typed letter on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, reproduced by Izvestia, is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.\" Kalashnikov's funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin. The AK-47 is widely manufactured unlicenced around the world and has become a visual hallmark of armed insurgent movements, including those using child soldiers. The Russian Orthodox Church has sought to consolidate its new-found strength after the Soviet era by building up close ties with state agencies and powerful officials. When Kalashnikov was feted by the Soviet authorities, it would have been unthinkable for him to have declared himself anything else than an atheist. \n",

      "Prediction: On November 1, 2013, a gunman opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing one Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer and injuring three others. The gunman, identified as 23-year-old Paul Ciancia, entered Terminal 3 with an assault rifle and a note in his bag that said he wanted to \"kill TSA\" and stir fear in them. He was shot by airport police officers four times and taken into custody. TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez, who was about 20 feet from an exit, was wheeled out by police to an ambulance 33 minutes after being shot in the chest. It is unclear whether immediate medical attention could have saved his life. \n",

      "The investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and officials are examining what conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier. TSA workers at LAX have been wondering the same thing, and representatives for the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department, and Los Angeles Airport Police said they couldn't comment on the ongoing investigation until extensive reports are finished. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the chaotic moments after the gunfire began, officials worried there could be bombs in the terminal and tried to determine whether the gunman had any accomplices. Officers from multiple agencies bent down to check on Hernandez before moving on, but no officers rendered first aid on scene. Finally, airport police put Hernandez in a wheelchair and ran him to an ambulance. \n",
      "\n",
      "The shooting has raised questions about coordination between police and fire officials, and whether a lack of coordination prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and other victims. TSA workers at LAX have been wondering the same thing, and a recent audit by Los Angeles Police Commission Inspector General Alex Bustamante found that the LAPD had a zero percent compliance rate. Only 250-sworn officers in the Metropolitan Division out of the department's more than 9,900 sworn officers received the refresher training, it states. \n",

The same day, authorities announced that the condition of the alleged gunman, Paul Ciancia, had been upgraded from critical to fair.

      "Prediction: European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton met with deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, the first contact he has had with an independent official since he was taken into military custody almost a month ago. Ashton, a low-key British diplomat, said she was taken by military helicopter late Monday to meet with Morsi. She declined to go into detail about her two-hour conversation with him, but she said he had access to newspapers and television and was in good condition. Ashton's two-day visit appeared to have at least temporarily calmed the tense capital after a weekend of violence left at least 80 pro-Morsi demonstrators and a police officer dead, according to the Health Ministry. Morsi's supporters rallied in Cairo on Tuesday night and marched toward the military intelligence headquarters, although no violence had been reported by early Wednesday. Ashton met with a wide range of Egyptian political figures, including Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, the commander of the armed forces; liberal activists and politicians who supported the coup; and a hard-line Islamist party that backed Morsi's removal but has since wavered in its support for the military. She also met with representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood. Ashton said Monday that she hoped the meetings would facilitate conversations that might lead to a political solution. But she stressed that Egyptians, and particularly those in power, must ensure that the country moves forward along a democratic path. Officials from the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, from which Morsi hails, told Ashton that any political solution for Egypt must be based on \"the return of the president,\" the party said in a statement. The statement said the demonstrations in support of Morsi would not stop until \"constitutional legitimacy\" was restored. His backers have used that phrase to refer to returning him to power, as well as to reinstating the country's Islamist-dominated parliament and the constitution ratified under Morsi through a popular referendum. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke by telephone Tuesday with Sissi, a Hagel spokesman said, adding that the secretary urged \"restraint\" in dealing with protesters and called for \"an inclusive reconciliation process.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Ashton's meeting with Morsi and her subsequent meetings with various Egyptian political figures suggest that the EU is trying to facilitate a political solution to the ongoing crisis in Egypt. However, the fact that Morsi's supporters are demanding his return to power and the reinstatement of the Islamist-dominated parliament and constitution suggests that a peaceful resolution may be difficult to achieve. The ongoing violence between security forces and pro-Morsi demonstrators also\n"

      "Prediction: The Navy's regional commander postponed a scheduled port call in Naples, Italy, for a destroyer so that the ship would remain with a second destroyer in striking distance of Syria during the crisis. The decision did not reflect any specific orders from Washington, but both destroyers had on board Tomahawk cruise missiles, long-range weapons that probably would be among the first launched against targets in Syria should the president decide to take military action. The Russian government called on President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to allow United Nations investigators into the areas east of Damascus where the attack occurred. However, American and foreign diplomats said Russia's move did not reflect any shift in its backing of Mr. Assad or its resistance to punitive measures in the Security Council. The Syrian government did not comment on Friday. American intelligence agencies detected activity at locations known to be chemical weapons sites before Wednesday's attack. The activity, these officials believe, may have been preparations for the assault. \n",

      "Prediction: Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, is seeking to recover $972,814 in legal costs from Ellen Pao, the former partner who recently lost a high-profile sex-discrimination case against the firm. The firm has offered to waive its attempt to recover legal costs from Pao if she agrees not to pursue an appeal in her gender discrimination case against the firm. The offer was made in papers filed this week in California Superior Court in San Francisco. The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition and court reporter costs. The vast majority of the fees Kleiner is trying to recover are for witnesses. The fees for Paul Gompers, a professor at Harvard Business School, were $92,700, the filing says. Kleiner Perkins also revealed it offered to settle the case with Pao before it went to trial, offering her almost $1 million, but it said Pao’s lawyers didn’t respond. A jury at the end of March rejected all of Ms. Pao’s claims. Legal fees, which must have been considerable on both sides, are not on the table. The judge in the case, Harold Kahn, made no obvious rulings that seemed to favor the defense. If anything, the opposite was true. He declined to allow testimony about Ms. Pao’s husband, Alphonse Fletcher Jr., whose hedge fund is bankrupt. Debra S. Katz, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who specializes in gender discrimination suits, said Kleiner sounded a little punitive. “If Kleiner wanted to look classy, it could have said, ‘This was hard fought and we obviously disagree with your view, but it’s in the interest of all parties to walk away. In the meantime, there have been lessons learned and we are going to fund organizations that focus on glass ceiling issues,’ ” Ms. Katz said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the case has sparked a wide discussion about gender at the center of the U.S. technology industry. The trial helped shed light on the challenges women face in the tech industry, and the need for greater gender diversity. However, the outcome of the case has been criticized by some as being unfair to women, and the legal fees incurred by both sides have been seen as excessive. The case is ongoing, and it remains to be seen whether Pao will pursue an appeal.\n"

      "Prediction: Jack McCullough, a 76-year-old man from Washington state, has been released from prison after a judge ordered him to be granted a new trial. McCullough was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. McCullough's lawyers and Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. Schmack concluded that he'd found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough had been convicted of a crime he didn't commit. The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning. The dark-haired second-grader with big brown eyes was with her playmate, Kathy Sigman, on December 3, 1957 when they were approached by a stranger who said his name was Johnny. He gave Maria two piggyback rides, Sigman told police at the time. Sigman, now a grandmother known as Kathy Chapman, said she went home to fetch her mittens. When she returned, Maria and Johnny were gone. More than 600 volunteers combed the fields and woods around Sycamore in search of Maria, at times walking hand-in-hand in a grid pattern. And within 24 hours, dozens of FBI agents descended on the small farming community about 65 miles west of Chicago. Agents interviewed some 200 possible suspects -- including McCullough, who passed a polygraph test about his alibi and was cleared. Despite the work of nearly three-dozen FBI agents, the investigation turned up no solid leads to Maria's whereabouts. Maria's body was discovered 144 days later by a couple looking for mushrooms near the Iowa border. She was under a fallen\n"

      "Prediction: The news this week has been dominated by the fallout from Rush Limbaugh's comments about Georgetown student Sandra Fluke. Saturday Night Live opened their show with a sketch featuring Limbaugh, played by Taran Killam, who was criticized for his remarks about birth control. The sketch was amusing but felt repetitive, with Limbaugh's shouty delivery unable to distract from the reality that the joke was the same repeated about twenty times. Meanwhile, 98 advertisers have told Premiere Radio Networks that they want to avoid advertising on Limbaugh's show and other programs with content deemed to be offensive or controversial. The list includes carmakers, insurance companies, and restaurants. Advertisers have dropped their ads from Limbaugh's show in the wake of his misogynistic attacks on Sandra Fluke. The online feed at WABC, Limbaugh's flagship station, has increasingly turned to free public service announcements during Limbaugh's show. Overall, the news this week has been focused on the controversy surrounding Limbaugh's comments and the impact they have had on advertisers and the media industry as a whole.\n"

      "Prediction: Greg Gianforte, the Montana congressman-elect, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for body-slamming a reporter during his campaign for Montana's at-large congressional seat. He was sentenced to a 180-day deferred sentence, 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management, and a $300 fine along with a $85 court fee. Gianforte apologized to the journalist, Ben Jacobs, and pledged to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. President Trump made light of Gianforte's physical assault on a reporter at a Montana rally, saying he had no regret for it. Trump praised Gianforte, saying he was a great person and a tough cookie. The White House Correspondents' Association condemned the president's comments. Trump came to Montana to attack Senator Jon Tester, a two-term Democratic senator, who is in a close race against Matt Rosendale, the current state auditor. Trump has made it his mission to unseat Tester, whose office publically released information about alleged misconduct that led to White House physician Adm. Ronny Jackson’s failed nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Trump spoke about immigration and falsely said that Democrats are supporting a caravan of immigrants traveling up from Central America. Trump said that the midterm elections will be “an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense -- that’s what it’s going to be.” Trump also talked about Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren’s DNA test in a state home to many Indian reservations. While Trump comfortably won the Big Sky state by 20 points, Tester maintains a slight lead in what has become one of the most expensive political contests in the small state’s history as millions of dollars have poured into Montana. It’s the president’s third trip to Montana, and Tester is only a few points ahead of Rosendale in recent polls. Tester has touted a bipartisan record in the Senate, even publishing a full-page newspaper ad at the beginning of the summer thanking the president for signing 16 of his bills into law on everything from government waste to veterans affairs. While the president’s ire toward Tester is rooted in Jackson, many of the voters ABC News spoke with before the rally began didn't seem to know his name.\n"

      "Prediction: Recent research has shown that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. MRSA, a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia, becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. The study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, enhancing survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. MRSA exposed to the smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The study also found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. The smoke-exposed MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for the alternative theory that cigarette smoke makes the pathogen tougher. The study was performed to examine an alternative to the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker. The study found that cigarette smoke both harms smokers and assists pathogens. The study was funded in part by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. \n",

      "In a similar study conducted by researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier, e-cigarette vapor was found to alter the structure of MRSA’s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria.

      "Prediction: The most important person in the English-language world is Frank Sinatra, according to an analysis of Wikipedia articles led by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom. The study used methods borrowed from Google to analyze Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. The study found that the most important person in the world comes out as Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist. The researchers applied a second way of measuring importance: CheiRank. Simply put, \"the PageRank… of an article is proportional to the number of incoming links, while the CheiRank… of an article is proportional to the number of outgoing links. Thus a top PageRank article is important since other articles refer to it, while a top CheiRank article is highly connected because it refers to other articles.\" In other words, an important person is likely to have a lot of other important people and things involved in their lives. The study takes as its starting point Google's PageRank algorithm.

      "Prediction: The article discusses the ratings of the new season of NBC's Celebrity Apprentice, which premiered on Monday night with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the new host. The show lost the ratings battle with rival networks ABC and CBS during the 8 p.m. ET primetime slot. The latest iteration of Comcast-owned NBC's Apprentice reality TV franchise—which featured now president-elect Donald Trump as host for more than a decade—lost the ratings battle with rival networks ABC and CBS (cbs) during the 8 p.m. ET primetime slot on Monday night. With Schwarzenegger now in the hosting chair, The New Celebrity Apprentice averaged roughly 4.9 million total viewers across its two-hour premiere, according to Nielsen's tracking numbers. The ratings for last night's Celebrity Apprentice premiere were down more than 22% from the debut episode of Trump's most recent season hosting (2014-2015). The show averaged 7.6 million nightly viewers in that season, and the ratings for the key demographic (viewers aged 18 to 49) across that season was roughly 46% higher than what Schwarzenegger's debut scored on Monday. The network has been pushing the show's new host and new season for months, including weathering last month's controversy over the fact that president-elect Trump will continue receiving an executive producer credit on the show going forward. To be fair, the Celebrity Apprentice premiere faced stiff Monday night competition that included The Bachelor premiere as well as a thrilling college football game in the Penn State-USC Rose Bowl matchup on ESPN (dis). Still, NBC (cmcsa) was likely hoping for a more impressive start to the post-Trump era of its Apprentice franchise, even though some early reviews for the Schwarzenegger-led show were not particularly kind. When reached for comment, NBC ratings guru Tom Bierbaum noted that last year's season premiere of the Celebrity Apprentice did not face major sports competition and that Monday's premiere still managed to provide a strong lead-in for new NBC gameshow The Wall, which retained most of the Apprentice's viewers to share the top ratings in the 10 p.m. time-slot among the key younger demographic. \n",

      "Prediction: The New York Jets cheerleaders have won a $325,000 settlement from the team in a New Jersey court. The settlement covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 NFL seasons and will give each of the 52 cheerleaders $2,500 per season they’ve worked. Squad members featured in photo shoots are also eligible for an additional $400 payment per shoot. The class-action suit, filed in 2014 by a cheerleader identified only as Krystal C, claimed the women made only $150 per game and nothing for practice time. The Jets denied the claims and both parties declined further comment. State Sen. Diane Savino applauded the settlement and called for the Buffalo Bills to do the same, to ensure that their cheerleaders are not left out in the cold when it comes to fair pay and treatment. The Bills cheerleaders were recently granted class-action status in a similar wage suit against their team. The Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Oakland Raiders, and Buffalo Bills have also been sued. The teams have tried to justify the low pay by labeling cheerleaders as independent contractors and not employees. However, the courts haven't agreed with that distinction. The Buccaneers reached a settlement of $825,000, and the Bengals have reached a tentative pact with their cheerleaders. The Raiders also settled for $1.25 million in September 2014. The cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills, the Jills, were recently given authorization to bring a class-action lawsuit against the team.\n"

      "Prediction: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned against a polio-like illness that is causing paralysis among an increasing number of Americans. Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and the cause is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Symptoms include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and, most severely, respiratory failure that can occur when muscles involved in breathing become weak. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but rather neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. The best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. In August 2014, physicians at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colorado, noted a cluster of cases of acute limb weakness among children, which coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). As of November 13, 2014, CDC had verified reports of 88 cases in 32 states. The median age of patients was 7.6 years, and 54 (61%) were males. Limb weakness was asymmetrical in most patients. Cranial nerve motor dysfunction was reported in 30 (34%) cases. Six (7%) patients had altered mental status, and three (3%) had seizures. Most patients reported a respiratory illness (81%), a febrile illness (68%), or both, occurring before neurologic symptom onset; 8% had neither condition. Among 86 patients for whom past medical history was reported, 65 (76%) were previously healthy, and 21 (24%) had underlying illnesses, most commonly asthma (nine [10%]). All but one patient was hospitalized because of neurologic illness, and 17 (19%) required ventilator support. Among 80 patients from whom cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 68 (85%) showed a moderate pleocytosis and normal or mildly elevated protein. Information regarding current clinical status was reported for 77 patients (median follow-up = 19 days). Of those, 49 (64%) reported some symptom improvement, and 28 (36%) showed no improvement; none were fully recovered. No deaths were reported. Among 71\n"

      "Prediction: The Shroud of Turin, a piece of cloth that bears the image of a crucified man and has been revered by some Christians as the burial cloth of Jesus, has been found to have inconsistent bloodstain patterns that suggest it is a fake, according to a new forensic investigation. The investigation, which was reported in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, is the first such analysis of the cloth, looking at its purported blood splatters and their alignment to each other in a kind of crime scene analysis. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse, adding to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The bloodstain pattern investigation was conducted by forensic anthropologist Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and organic chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences. They used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points depicted on the shroud, they could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction seen on the linen. They discovered the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. The researchers found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. If it were a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, “the bloodstains shouldn’t be so inconsistent.” The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic, and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. The Shroud of Turin has long been the subject of debate and study, with radiocarbon dating determining its origin to be between 1260 and 1390. It is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, and more than 2 million people came to see the shroud during a three-month display in 2015, including Pope Francis. The findings of the investigation have been published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences.\n"

      "Prediction: President Obama has signed a bill authorizing the prestigious Congressional Gold Medal award for the Nisei veterans who fought for the United States during World War II. The Nisei refers to Japanese Americans born to immigrants who went overseas to fight for the United States, while the U.S. government kept their families locked in detention camps for the duration of the war. The Congressional Gold Medal will honor the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the Military Intelligence Service for their heroic service and sacrifice during World War II. The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was an all-Japanese-American regiment, it was formed mostly of young men whose families had been shipped to detainment camps because of their race. The new law will recognize over 6,000 Japanese-Americans born of immigrant parents who served our country and fought in battles in Europe and Asia. The Congressional Gold Medal is one of the highest civilian honors presented to people who serve the security and national interests of the United States. Past honorees of the Congressional Gold Medal include the Wright Brothers, Rosa Parks, Navajo Code Talkers, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Dalai Lama. The Go For Broke vets came home 65 years ago, and many surviving vets live in the Northwest. The Go For Broke veterans gained a reputation for toughness in France and Italy, and they became famous for the rescue of so-called “Lost Battalion”, a unit of Texas National Guardsmen who’d been cut off behind German lines. The 442nd suffered terrible losses, with some companies decimated to just a few men by the end of the war. Congress honors veterans of the 442nd with the Congressional Gold Medal this week.\n"

      "Prediction: The article discusses the net worth of US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr. And how he has been accused of lying about his assets. Ross claimed to have a net worth of $3.7 billion, but after examining his financial-disclosure forms, Forbes found that he was closer to $700 million. Ross protested, citing trusts for his family that he said he did not have to disclose in federal filings. However, Forbes planned to remove him entirely from the list for the first time in 13 years. Ross' questionable assertions to Forbes, combined with a recent controversy about a multimillion-dollar stake in a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin, paint a clearer picture of the commerce secretary's tactics. Ross' penchant for misleading extended to colleagues and investors, resulting in millions of dollars in fines, tens of millions refunded to backers and numerous lawsuits. Additionally, according to six U.S. Senators, Ross failed to initially mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process. Ross' appointment as secretary of commerce came with one catch: He had to disclose his assets, providing evidence that he was not as rich as he had long claimed. In 2015, he sent Forbes a detailed breakdown of his supposed holdings, listing $1.25 billion in partnership interests, $1.1 billion in municipal bonds, $500 million in equities, $200 million in art, $110 million in real estate and $200 million in cash, for a fanciful total of $3.4 billion, according to notes taken at the time. We eventually listed him at $2.9 billion. Last year, Ross' assistant claimed $3.7 billion; we stuck with $2.9 billion. Ross' former colleagues saw the moment of reckoning coming as soon as he accepted a Cabinet role. \"It was surprising because he would have to reveal to the world that he wasn't a billionaire,\" one ex-employee said. \"I was surprised that he would take that risk.\" Ross was ready to double down, even while he was a Cabinet member, telling Forbes about the putative $2 billion asset transfer to his family members after the election. That opened up a storm of questions from ethics and tax experts. If Ross had owned $2 billion of additional assets before the election, wouldn't they have produced income that he was required to disclose, even if he no longer owned the assets? And why would someone apparently transfer $2 billion to his family, thereby triggering more than $800 million\n"

      "Prediction: Frances Bean Cobain's estranged husband, Isaiah Silva, is requesting spousal support from her, claiming that he left a steady job when they got married and Frances promised to cover a bunch of his monthly expenses, including paying private school and housing bills for his child from a previous relationship. Isaiah says Frances wants to renege on those commitments. He is requesting $25,000 a month in spousal support and claims that he deserves half of the money she earned off business deals made during the two-year marriage. Frances Bean has been trying to get her father's most priceless guitar back from Isaiah since they split in March 2016. Isaiah claims that Frances Bean gifted him the guitar as a wedding present when they secretly married in 2014. Frances Bean denies that she gifted it to him. The guitar is so valuable that Love's manager has even allegedly sent a string of threatening messages to Silva's ex-girlfriend in an attempt to get him to hand the historic instrument over. The fight over the guitar is heading for a bitter, multimillion-dollar court battle. Frances Bean's side says that Silva is taking \"extreme and unsupportable positions\" on the disagreement. The guitar is believed to be the last Kurt played before his death and is worth several times its insured value of $1 million. Frances Bean's side says that Silva is forcing the matter to litigation. An insider tells us that in September, a judge ordered Frances Bean to pay Silva $15,000 a month in spousal support as part of an interim settlement while they worked out the guitar issue through mediation. Reps for an attorney for Silva didn't get back to us.\n"

      "Prediction: Actors Alyssa Milano and Matt Damon have been involved in a heated debate over the severity of sexual misconduct. Milano called out Damon for his comments on sexual harassment, which she felt were dismissive of the severity of the issue. Damon argued that there is a \"spectrum\" to behavior, and that we live in a \"culture of outrage.\" He also stated that there is a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. However, Milano argued that the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous and that it is righteous. She also pointed out that the micro issues make the macro issues. Milano and other actors, including Minnie Driver, have called out Damon for his comments, which they feel are tone deaf and part of the problem. Driver argued that men cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level and should not attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women. She also stated that there is no hierarchy of abuse and that all abuse is equal. Driver believes that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand. Since the first publication of allegations against Harvey Weinstein, several women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. Matt Damon addressed the sexual allegations against Harvey Weinstein, saying, \"I knew I wouldn't want him married to anyone close to me.\" Damon also spoke about the importance of raising children with self-esteem and preparing them for the world they live in. He believes that the day of confidentiality agreements is over and that settlements will no longer be possible. Milano and Driver have called for a change in the industry, where women have been told they can't express what happened to them. They believe that the avalanche of men losing their careers is only 1% of the guys who are losing their careers. They hope that the rotten horrible apples are getting weeded out right now, and that's progress. However, they also believe that we need to get to a place where we're looking at one end of the spectrum and saying, \"Well, let's deal with this with some reflection and dialogue and some reconciliation, and let's all grow together and move on.\" \n",

      "Prediction: The Unabomber's personal effects are being auctioned off to pay off a $15 million restitution order to his victims and their families. The auction includes his manifesto, which currently has a bid of $17,525, and his iconic hoodie, which is up to $20,025. Other items include his Smith-Corona typewriter, which is currently around the $11,000 mark. The auction ends on June 2, and all the money raised will be used to pay off the restitution order. Art historian and appraiser Elyse Luray believes there is value to be found in the auction, despite some items attracting less attention. Crime memorabilia collectors like Scott Michaels think there is a lot of value in being able to tell friends and neighbors that the saw they are borrowing was once used by the Unabomber. Michaels makes no bones about his hobby, but admits he often has to defend it. The market for crime memorabilia has been going on for a few hundred years, according to criminologist Jeffery Ian Ross Ph.D. Celebrities are auctioning off their travel items to raise funds for youth groups across the country. Kellan Lutz is teaming up with JetBlue and DoSomething.org as part of their big celebrity baggage auction. The first round of items auctioned off raised more than $15,000, and Lutz's bags along with items from Taylor Swift, Jessica Simpson and others will be a part of the second round. The film reel Charlie Chaplin in Zepped, which shows the famous British actor bringing down a German Zeppelin during a London raid, is set to command a six-figure sum. It is thought that the picture, which was released in 1917, was made as a morale-boosting film for British troops during World War One. The seven minute long reel is thought to contain some of the earliest known animation. \n",

      "Prediction: The situation in Mali is dire as the north of the country is in the hands of a Tuareg rebellion. The coup that ousted President Amadou Toumani Touré has led to a power vacuum in the capital Bamako, allowing the rebels to gain possession of northern Mali at lightning speed. The rebels, who are mostly Tuareg people, want to establish an independent Tuareg state called Azawad. The Malian army is falling apart, and the junta that overthrew the president has not sent any troops north to defend the country from the rebels. West African leaders are responding quickly to try and avoid an outright collapse of the Malian state, but the situation is complicated by the fact that some of the presidents of the region have faced mutinies in their own countries. The African Union has joined West African nations in imposing sanctions on Mali after a recent coup, and the UN Security Council is due to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis in Mali later on Tuesday. The sanctions have caused long lines at petrol stations in the capital, Bamako, as the landlocked West African nation braced itself for the embargo. The rebels are divided into two groups - the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which wants independence for the northern Tuareg homelands, while Ansar Dine, which is linked to the North African branch of al-Qaeda, wants to remain part of Mali but impose Sharia. The rebel takeover could disrupt efforts to preserve Timbuktu's manuscripts, some of which have already been destroyed. The situation in Mali will have significant consequences for the whole of the Sahel region.\n"

      "Prediction: Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, which is added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing child institutions and orphanages, was established after a black-and-white photograph of a small boy locked in a caged bed in a residential institution was published in a newspaper. The charity sheds light on the lives of millions of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The vast majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but they are placed in institutions due to a lack of local education and health facilities, especially for children with special needs. Institutionalisation causes children measurable and sometimes irreparable harm, and the effects are profound. Damage is done very early, and it is lasting. Cut off from society, institutionalised children return to the world with their chances of a happy, healthy life greatly impaired, often unable to find employment, excluded from the community, and more likely to enter into a lifetime of poverty and dependency. Lumos estimates that the institutionalisation of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 – in our lifetime. Ending the practice of keeping children in institutions isn't just a moral imperative; it makes excellent economic sense. It is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution – and this also reduces long-term costs, since these children are far less likely to become dependent in adulthood. Lumos has achieved successes in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. The commitments made by the EU, the US, and the Global Alliance for Children have set an important precedent for other donors. Everyone has a role to play in ending the harmful and unnecessary practice of institutionalisation, which is precisely the idea behind the social media campaign #letstalklumos launched last month. Keeping this issue alive and creating awareness is a vital part of changing the future for these children.\n"

      "Prediction: The US and Pakistan have agreed to work together in any future actions against \"high value targets\" in Pakistan. This pledge was made in a joint statement and could help to ease tensions between the two countries. However, details of the promised cooperation are unclear. US Senator John Kerry has defended Washington's decision not to inform Islamabad in advance about the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Kerry said that the secrecy surrounding the Abbottabad operation was not a reflection of US distrust and that the United States was determined to avoid leaks at all costs. Kerry also said that the US has \"no designs\" on Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. The US uses Pakistan as a key supply route for US troops in Afghanistan, and Pakistan's assistance is viewed as crucial to a potential negotiated end to the war there. Pakistan needs US assistance to help arm its military and shore up its teetering economy. The relationship between the two countries has reached one of its worst points after the US raid that killed bin Laden in a Pakistani garrison city. Pakistan has chafed at not being informed of the raid in advance, while US officials have openly questioned whether Pakistani officials colluded with bin Laden. Kerry sought to play down allegations that Pakistan harbors terrorists and emphasized that he was in Pakistan to \"recalibrate\" the relationship, not judge whether Pakistan harbors terrorists. Kerry said that commitments were made to increase US-Pakistan intelligence sharing and joint intelligence operations, which had come to a near standstill in recent months. Kerry also announced that Pakistan had agreed to return the tail of a stealth US helicopter that American commandos had to destroy during the bin Laden raid because it malfunctioned. Kerry said that the make-or-break of the relationship is real and that actions, not words, are going to be critical to earning the votes of members of Congress who have called for the end to US aid. Kerry did not specify other steps agreed to during his meetings, although he said that Pakistan had agreed to return the tail of the US military helicopter that was damaged during the bin Laden raid. Kerry also said that Pakistan had agreed to explore how increased cooperation on joint operations and intelligence sharing can maximize efforts to defeat enemies. Kerry's visit to Pakistan is a sign of confidence in the relationship, and he conveyed to Pakistani leaders that they must demonstrate a commitment to fighting Islamist militancy to address the concerns of members of Congress who have called for the end to US aid. Kerry said that the make-or-break of the relationship is real and that actions, not words, are going to be critical to earning the\n"

      "Prediction: The news revolves around the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. He was killed by a highly toxic nerve agent, VX, which is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. Malaysia's police chief announced that the presence of the nerve agent had been detected in swabs taken from Kim's eyes and face. The authorities say they intend to decontaminate the airport and areas the suspects are known to have visited. VX is a v-type nerve agent, which means the substance can remain lethal for a long period of time. The death of Kim Jong Nam has unleashed a diplomatic crisis that escalates by the day. North Korea has denounced Malaysia's investigation as full of \"holes and contradictions\" and accused the authorities here of being in cahoots with Pyongyang's enemies. The case has perplexed toxicologists, who question how the two women could have walked away unscathed after handling a powerful poison, even if — as Malaysian police say — the women were instructed to wash their hands right after the attack. North Korea is one of just six countries not to have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) arms control treaty banning the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. It is suspected of being particularly focused on mustard, phosgene, sarin and V-type chemical agents — substances including VX that are designed to poison through contact and remain lethal for long periods of time. The North's development of such agents has been of special concern because of fears it might try to put them in artillery shells for an attack on South Korea's capital, potentially threatening the lives of millions. Malaysia has three people in custody in connection with Kim Jong Nam's death, including the two suspected attackers. Authorities are also seeking several other people, including the second secretary of North Korea's embassy in Kuala Lumpur and an employee of North Korea's state-owned airline, Air Koryo. The case has marked a serious turnaround in relations between Malaysia and North Korea. While Malaysia isn't one of Pyongyang's key diplomatic partners, it is one of the few places in the world where North Koreans can travel without a visa. As a result, for years, it's been a quiet destination for Northerners looking for jobs, schools, and business deals.\n"

      "Prediction: On Saturday night, a 15-year-old girl was gang-raped and beaten on the grounds of Richmond High School in California. Up to two dozen people witnessed the attack but did nothing to stop it. The victim, a sophomore, had left the dance and was drinking alcohol in a school courtyard with a group when she was attacked. Two suspects, a 21-year-old Richmond man and a 15-year-old boy who attends the school, have been arrested. Police believe that as many as 10 assailants, ranging in age from 15 to their early 20s, committed a \"slew of crimes\" against the girl - including raping her and stealing her jewelry. The men laughed and took photos as they took turns assaulting the girl. Police expect to make more arrests, and authorities are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of any of the assailants. The attack has raised questions about campus security, as Richmond High has surveillance cameras but none is working. The school recently approved surveillance cameras after a series of violent crimes. The attack occurred in a city that has dealt with its share of vicious crimes in recent years, and the school recently approved surveillance cameras after a series of violent crimes. In one case a few years back, a student was shot outside the school, ran inside and died in the then-principal's hands, said Marin Trujillo, a spokesman for the West Contra Costa Unified School District. Richmond is an industrialized conclave near the San Francisco Bay that is known as one of the nation's most dangerous cities. In 2007, Richmond had 47 homicides, and the murder rate led the state for cities with populations of 100,000 or more, surpassing Los Angeles and Oakland. That number dropped to 27 in 2008 but has spiked to 44 killings so far this year, amid drug dealing and gang activity that has engulfed the town, police said. The attack began when someone in the group invited the girl to join in a drinking session after she left Richmond High's homecoming dance early about 9:30 p.m. Saturday, police said. The girl quickly became drunk, and the attack began. During the next two hours, as many as two dozen people may have witnessed the rapes or been aware of what was happening, but didn't report it, police said. Officers were finally alerted by a woman \"who was several blocks away who heard people discussing what was occurring\" at the school on 23rd Street and called police,\n"

      "Prediction: The Nunes memo, a document created by the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, alleges that the FBI abused its surveillance authority, particularly when it sought a secret court order to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser. The FBI and the Justice Department had lobbied strenuously against its release. The memo was released by President Trump after the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence voted to disclose it publicly. The President understands that the protection of national security represents his highest obligation, and he has directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the declassification of the memo. The Executive Branch stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests consistent with applicable standards and processes, including the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The memo raises concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), and it represents a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the ISA process. The memo also alleges that the Steele dossier, compiled by Christopher Steele on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign, formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application. Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, via the law firm Perkins Coie and research firm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia.

      "Prediction: Two daycare workers, Lizandra Cosme and Susana Gonzalez, have been arrested and charged in connection with an incident at a Logan Square daycare in which five toddlers were injured with hot glue. Cosme, 32, was arrested on Sunday and charged with five counts of aggravated battery of a child under 13 years old causing great bodily harm. She was denied bail at a court appearance on Monday and is scheduled to return to court on Dec. 26. Gonzalez, 27, was charged with five misdemeanor counts of causing the circumstances of child endangerment. The incident occurred on Dec. 1 at the Children’s Learning Place in the 3100 block of West Fullerton. The extent of the children’s injuries is unknown. Cosme allegedly brought the glue gun to the daycare to use on a Christmas project and applied it directly to the hands and arms of five 2-year-old children. An assistant in the room with her at the time allegedly stood idly by, laughing with Cosme as this was taking place. The state Department of Children and Family Services is investigating allegations of abuse by one of the daycare workers. The daycare center terminated two employees immediately after the alleged incident and is working with investigators. The well-being of the students is paramount, according to the daycare center's spokeswoman.\n"

      "Prediction: Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis has revealed in her upcoming memoir that she had two abortions in the 1990s. The first was an ectopic pregnancy, which was medically necessary, and the second was due to a fetus with a severe brain abnormality. Davis writes about the difficult decisions she had to make and how they changed her forever. The memoir also details her struggles as a young mother and her journey to becoming a lawyer and politician. Davis' filibuster against tough new restrictions on abortion in Texas last year made her a national political sensation, but the restrictions were eventually passed. Davis is now running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Gov. Rick Perry next year. Anti-abortion groups have expressed sympathy for Davis' difficult decisions but hope that all decisions end in choosing to continue a pregnancy. Davis' memoir, \"Forgetting to be Afraid,\" goes on sale on Tuesday.\n"

      "Prediction: Two men, Joseph Van Wert and Randy Lambach, have been arrested for running a citywide prostitution ring in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The investigation began in the spring of 2017 after police received complaints about increased prostitution in the city. Most of the activity was centered around the areas of First, Adam, North, Linden, and Wahconah streets. The women involved were recruited by a white male named \"Randy\" who would seek out women with drug addictions, photograph them, and post advertisements online seeking clients for sexual services. Lambach would set up meetings and rates with prospective \"johns,\" and Van Wert would allow some of the meetings to take place in his third-floor apartment at the senior living facility in exchange for drugs and cash. Lambach would take a significant cut of the women's money or pay them in heroin, cocaine, or prescription drugs in lieu of cash. Some of the women he recruited were formerly his foster children. A witness said the victims looked to be as young as 15. Police arrested Van Wert and Lambach last week, and they are being held on human trafficking charges pending a dangerousness hearing on November 29. The investigation is ongoing, and additional charges may be coming.\n"

      "Prediction: Archaeologists have uncovered a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, at a dig in Wiltshire. The team from the University of Reading made the discovery while excavating Wilsford henge in the Vale of Pewsey. The body was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. Reading University archaeologist Dr Jim Leary described the skeleton as a \"wonderful discovery\". Scientific analysis will provide information on the gender of the child, diet, pathologies, and date of burial. It may also shed light on where this young individual had lived. The three-year Vale of Pewsey dig is a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. Findings to date include flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. Built in 2,400 BC, Marden henge is the largest prehistoric monument of its kind in the country. During the last six weeks, the team has focused on Marden henge and Wilsford henge. Dr Leary said, \"Finds from the first five weeks of the dig were exciting - but as so often during excavations, the best is revealed last.\" Duncan Wilson, of Historic England, said, \"Bigger than Avebury, 10 times the size of Stonehenge and halfway between the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Sites, comparatively little is known about this fascinating and ancient landscape. The work will help Historic England focus on identifying sites for protection and improved management, as well as adding a new dimension to our understanding of this important archaeological environment.\" The site welcomes visitors every day, but the open day will have finds on display, tours, and activities. It will be among more than 1,000 events across the country over the last fortnight of July, including lectures, site tours, and visits to archaeology stores and structures normally closed to the public.\n"

      "Prediction: The article discusses the controversy surrounding BP's CEO Bob Dudley's 20% increase in his total remuneration package for 2015 to $19.6 million. Some shareholders have criticized the decision, citing the company's $5.2 billion loss last year and the fact that it is slashing thousands of jobs in response to falling oil prices. However, BP's compensation committee awards executive bonuses based on the company's performance in a number of strategic areas, including its safety record and internal targets for operational cash flow and underlying profits. Despite the opposition, BP's chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg defended the pay package, saying that Dudley had met or exceeded every one of the targets he had been set. The vote is non-binding on BP, but the company has promised to review future pay terms in consultation with shareholders before next year. The article also notes that the vote is not the first time Glass Lewis has raised objections to BP's executive pay, and that the company's shareholders will vote on the matter this year at the company's annual general meeting in London on April 16, along with a host of other issues. The article also mentions that the early voting figures suggest that the opposition is even bigger than expected, and that the opposition is not just limited to BP, as other companies such as Smith & Nephew have also faced defeats on their remuneration reports. The article concludes by noting that the shareholder rebellion will determine the future of corporate governance in the UK, and that British boards are now in the last chance saloon if the will of shareholders in cases like this is ignored, it will only be a matter of time before the government introduces tougher regulations on executive pay.\n"

      "Prediction: Peru's top organized crime investigator, Eusebio Felix, has been suspended for misleading the public about a gang of serial killers who acted out an ancient Andean legend and sold their victims' fat. Felix claimed that four suspects apprehended by police were \"Pishtacos\" - the legendary killers who roam the Andes mountains extracting fat from travelers. However, it now appears that the story was nothing more than a tall tale or a big fat lie. Police initially said the gang murdered up to 60 victims and exported their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to Italian cosmetics makers. But in the end, there may have been only one victim. Police in Lima, the capital, said the investigation had been botched, and General Miguel Hidalgo, the head of Peru's police, said he was embarrassed. Police in Huanuco, who complain they were excluded from the inquiry, said there was only one murder victim and that he was linked to the cocaine trade. They believe the four alleged killers, who are still in custody, may have bottled his fat to intimidate their rivals in an area rife with drug trafficking and violence. Police have been harshly criticized for their handling of the case. Anthropologists said investigators foolishly believed the Pishtacos legend when searching for a motive for the murder, and then played on people's fears by turning the legend into reality. Doctors said it would be pointless to kill people to harvest their fat when it could be easily collected from plastic surgery clinics that perform tummy tucks. Some observers say this story was just one of many embellished or invented news stories used as a smokescreen which are intended to distract the general public from the real issues facing Peru.\n"

The book and movie have inspired many to embark on the 2,650-mile trail, with more than 4,000 long-distance hiking permits issued in 2016. The Pacific Crest Trail Association has implemented a quota system to mitigate wear on the trail and environmental damage, with a cap of 50 permits per day during the high season. However, some hikers are concerned about overcrowding and the impact it has on the fragile desert ecosystems. The PCTA has also launched a campaign to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" practices.

      "Prediction: Jeff Herman, a lawyer who has filed four lawsuits against Hollywood executives, including \"X-Men\" director Bryan Singer, has produced photos showing his latest client hanging with Singer shortly before an alleged sexual assault. The photos show the unidentified boy, who was 17 at the time, standing and sitting next to the famed director following the London premiere of the 2006 flick \"Superman Returns.\" The boy's face was blacked out, showing only his green and white striped sweater next to Singer's smiling face. One of the photos includes actress Kate Bosworth sitting in Singer's lap. According to a lawsuit filed Saturday in federal court, Singer offered the boy a Quaalude and plied him with alcohol before bringing him back to his London hotel suite with co-defendant Gary Goddard, a producer of theme park rides, for the alleged sexual assault. Singer and Goddard have denied the allegations and trashed the lawsuit, including its claims they groped the boy and stood by as a \"muscle-bound\" man smacked him around. The teen willingly partied with the men at first but protested when Singer removed his boxer shorts, the lawsuit states. Singer allegedly didn't listen and ordered the teen to sit on top of him and masturbate, according to the suit. Singer also tried to penetrate him anally, the lawsuit, which identifies the teen only as John Doe No. 117, claims. Herman said the man, now 25, contacted him after learning that another client, Michael Egan III, recently sued Singer, Goddard and two other media moguls claiming molestation at drug and alcohol-fueled house parties in the late 1990s. John Doe No. 117 says he was 14 years old when Goddard, now 59, first contacted him via social media and promised to introduce him to people who could help his acting career. The suit claims the boy's relationship with Goddard quickly jumped from online webcam sex to real sex when Goddard traveled to meet him. Goddard — who has produced Broadway productions of \"Hair\", \"Jekyll & Hyde\" and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" — allegedly sent the teen a disturbing email after their meeting. Herman showed the email to reporters Monday, saying it was part of the physical evidence he will use in the case. \"The closest thing I have to a 'naughty' shot of you,\" the email, allegedly sent from Goddard's email address, stated. \"Haha — its not all that\n"

Mollie Olgin was killed, while Mary Kristene Chapa survived the attack. The police have not yet determined if the shooting was a hate crime, but they are not ruling it out. The Texas Rangers are assisting Portland Police with the investigation. Mary Kristene Chapa's family has set up a donation page to help pay for her medical bills, as she is without insurance. The families of both girls have reached out to each other, but have not yet met due to the emotional trauma of the shooting. The community has rallied around the families, with a Facebook event for a \"candle lit walk in memory of Olgin and to keep Kristene Chapa in prayers for a speedy\" recovery gaining 741 participants. Mollie Olgin's father is confident that her killer will be caught and brought to justice. A memorial service for Olgin will be held on Friday, followed by a candlelight vigil for both girls at the Violet Andrews Park.

      "Prediction: Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur that lived 160 million years ago in what is now northeastern China. The dinosaur, named Caihong juji, had feathers that may have glittered with the colors of the rainbow. The feathers on its head and chest seem to have been covered with iridescent feathers akin to those on modern hummingbirds. The flashy display may have provided a social or sexual cue, like modern peacock tails. The dinosaur also has a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it has a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ancient animal has been named Caihong juji—Mandarin for “rainbow with the big crest”—the team reports today in the journal Nature Communications. Caihong lived in forests and may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards, says study co-author Xing Xu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In life, the duck-size carnivore would’ve weighed roughly a pound. \n",
      "\n",
      "The team sampled 66 sites across the fossil, comparing the melanosomes they saw with melanosomes from modern bird feathers. On Caihong’s head, chest, and parts of its tail, the researchers saw melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets. These patterns most closely match the melanosomes in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds. The team couldn’t reconstruct the dinosaur feathers’ exact colors, but they suspect that the observed pigments gave Caihong a rainbow glimmer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Caihong may not have used just its feathers for showing off, notes University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte, who reviewed the study before publication. “Its plumage was a shiny rainbow of iridescent colors … but it didn't stop there,” he says. “It also had a funky crest of bone sticking up in front of its eyes, which was probably a display structure as well.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Caihong is now the oldest known animal to have asymmetrical feathers, a trait used by birds to steer when flying. The iconic bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx also has asymmetrical feathers, but it lived ten million years later. With Caihong, “who knows what the functions of this large, wide tail were?” says National Geographic explorer Ryan Carney, a University of South Florida biologist who studies Archaeopteryx. “Perhaps it was held up as a dark background\n"

In Libya, security forces have fired on pro-democracy demonstrators, resulting in at least 15 deaths. In Yemen, police opened fire on protesters, killing one and injuring five others. In Bahrain, thousands of protesters returned to the capital's central Pearl Square after the armed forces withdrew from the streets. In Algeria, police thwarted a rally by pro-democracy supporters, breaking up the crowd into isolated groups to keep them from marching. The article also mentions the ongoing protests in Tunisia and Egypt, which have already toppled autocrats. The governments of Libya, Yemen, and Algeria have resorted to violence to crush unrest before it gathers momentum that might threaten their grip on power. The article also mentions the political grievances in places like Benghazi, which have deepened with the crackdown. The article concludes by stating that the protests are part of a larger movement for change in the Arab world, with calls for political reform and an end to corruption and repression.\n"

Wright was a brilliant cook, food historian, and champion of hunting and shooting who became an unlikely television star. She was a great British eccentric who was known for her strong opinions and commanding presence on television. Wright grew up in an affluent family but her father was an alcoholic who beat her and her mother. She became a barrister but quit law after descending into alcoholism. She got serious about cooking in her 40s and was discovered by TV producer Patricia Llewellyn. Wright and her co-star Jennifer Paterson were brought together for Two Fat Ladies in 1996, during which they traveled the UK in a motorcycle-sidecar in search of good British grub. The show led to a book in 1998, but it attracted criticism for the high-fat ingredients the pair loved. After Paterson's death in 1999, Wright appeared in other television programs, including Clarissa and the Countryman with presenter, naturalist, and baronet Sir John (Johnny) Scott. Wright was also an outspoken campaigner for rural life and a keen supporter of the Countryside Alliance. She recently said that she had enjoyed a \"fantastic life\" and had done everything she could have wanted to do and more. Wright was proud of her time working with students as the Rector of the University of Aberdeen between 1998-2004. She was christened Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda Dickson Wright and was the youngest of four children. She never married but while working at St James Club met Clive, \"the man I was to love more than any other in my life\". Wright has been declared bankrupt several times, having spent her £2.8 million inheritance on \"drinking and debauchery\".\n"

      "Prediction: An experienced mountain walker, Jane Wilson, fell to her death while looking for a safe route off Snowdonia's Tryfan peak. She and her husband, Gary, decided not to go to the summit during their walk on March 25. Instead, they used Mr Wilson's smartphone to guide them across the mountain's west face. Mrs Wilson fell 30ft down a vertical cliff and then tumbled about 150 metres down into an area known as Notch arrete. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death. The hearing was told Mrs Wilson was a fit and active woman and that she and her husband had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years. The inquest heard that Mrs Wilson had fractured her skull and sustained other severe injuries in the fall. The Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team found her body over 150 metres lower down. Detective Constable Tim Bird, the leader of the rescue team, said that although the weather was dry, the light boots worn by Mrs Wilson were not suitable for such rough terrain and she could have slipped. He also said that there would not have been as much detail on the smartphone app as on a normal map.

      "Prediction: Seattle has implemented a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, which has caused a stir among residents and businesses. The tax was intended to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for important projects, and subsidize purchases of healthy foods by low-income families. However, opponents argue that soda taxes don't make people healthier, they don't raise revenue, they drive it outside city limits, and they don't help ease inequality. They also argue that the tax is regressive, meaning it disproportionately affects low-income families. The tax has caused a significant increase in prices, with a case of Gatorade now costing $26.33, an increase of more than 64 percent. Business managers and customers are not stupid, and retailers like Costco have posted signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where shoppers can buy the product without paying the massive tax. Already, there is evidence that people are voting with their feet and buying drinks in the suburbs, depriving Seattle of the revenue it claims to need. The same thing happened to Philadelphia when it implemented a soda tax. Seattle's tax does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. The west coast is often ground zero for politicians who pride themselves on social engineering. In fact, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University revealed that three of the top five states with the most paternalistic laws are California, Oregon, and Washington. Nanny staters have looked to Seattle to fulfill their dream of running our lives. The people of the city need to speak up and end this nightmare. \n",
      "\n",
      "A bill is being re-introduced to bring the Seattle soda tax statewide. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold. Local representative Marcus Riccelli co-sponsored the bill originally, and said he doesn't believe the bill will go anywhere this year or be brought up for a committee vote. However, some are worried about the tax coming to Spokane. Seattle leaders say the tax is a good way to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Some here in Spokane agree that's a good thing. Seattle is expected to make $15 million this year from the tax. It will be using part of the money to help fund a program that provides healthy meals for low-income families. \n",

      "Prediction: On Sunday, a 34-year-old man named Jonathan Carlyle Merkley was celebrating his birthday at the Staybridge Suites hotel in San Diego when he was killed by a woman who was trying to leave the party. Merkley had been drinking with friends before the incident, and he tried to prevent the woman from leaving by lying down in front of her car. The woman did not stop and ran over Merkley, causing major trauma to his chest. He died at a hospital 45 minutes later. The woman who drove the car has not been arrested, and police are still investigating the incident.

Rebekah Martinez, a woman who was reported missing in November 2017, was found on the reality series \"The Bachelor\" and was removed from the California Department of Justice's website. The North Coast Journal published a cover story titled \"The Humboldt 35: Why does Humboldt County have the highest rate of missing persons reports in the state?\" which examined why Humboldt has the highest per-capita rate of people reported missing in California. The article also mentions that Humboldt County ranks sixth in the state per capita for missing children reports between 2010 and 2016. The article emphasizes that Humboldt County is a good place to disappear, and many people come to the area to work in the cannabis industry, leaving town to work on remote mountains where there is no cell phone service. The article also mentions that some people aren't actually missing and others just don't want to be found.

      "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. These disorders can cause physical and neurodevelopmental problems, including abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing. FASDs are preventable by avoiding alcohol during pregnancy, and while there is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy, drinking small amounts of alcohol does not cause abnormalities in the face but may cause behavioral issues. \n",

      "Prediction: A Central California woman, Myrna Arias, claims she was fired from her job at Intermex Wire Transfer LLC after refusing to install an app that tracked her location even when she was off the clock. The app, provided by Xora, contained a global positioning system function that tracked the exact location of the person possessing the smartphones on which it was installed. Arias claims that she was one of the first employees asked to put the app on her phone and that she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, calling it an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed her boss that his actions were illegal. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, said that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a \"legitimate business interest\" to do so, but if an employee can't stop it, then that is a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy. Arias is seeking an injunction and general, special and punitive damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination and unfair business practices. Intermex did not immediately respond for comment. \n",

A judge reduced his bond to zero and allowed him to be released from jail under electronic monitoring. Merritt has pleaded not guilty to drive-by shooting, aggravated assault, and other charges. The judge overseeing the case imposed a gag order on lawyers, so they could not discuss the evidence that prompted the shift in bond.

      "Prediction: On Thursday, a woman identified as Snochia Moseley, 26, killed three people and injured three others before taking her own life at a Rite Aid warehouse in Aberdeen, Maryland. Moseley was a temporary employee who showed up for work at her normal time at the facility near Aberdeen. She shot people outside the building and on the warehouse floor, according to Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler. The motive for the shooting is not yet known. The gun used in the shooting, a 9 mm Glock handgun, was registered and owned by Moseley, he said. Employees were shot both inside and outside the distribution center, Gahler said. The shooting in Perryman, an unincorporated area of the county near Aberdeen, was one of three to erupt in U.S. workplaces in the space of 24 hours and came less than a year after a gunman killed three fellow employees at another Harford County business. The shootings mark the latest spasm of gun violence to beset Maryland and other parts of the country. In June, a gunman stormed the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, killing five staff members. Jarrod Ramos, a Laurel man with a grudge against The Capital, is awaiting trial on 23 charges. In March, a student at Great Mills High School in Southern Maryland shot and killed a 16-year-old classmate and injured a 14-year-old boy. Around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, four people were shot at a software company, WTS Paradigm, in Middleton, Wis., by a 43-year-old co-worker, police said. The gunman was shot and killed by police. Three of the injured were in serious condition as of Thursday morning, one suffered a graze wound.

      "Prediction: A new study from Denmark suggests that pregnant women who frequently take acetaminophen, commonly found in over-the-counter pain relievers like Tylenol, may increase the risk of ADHD-like behavioral problems in their children. The study analyzed data from over 64,000 children enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002. The study authors concluded that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with HKD or being prescribed ADHD medications and “exhibiting ADHD-like behaviors.\" However, the study authors agree that their results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship. The data suggests that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks. When women reported use for 20 weeks or more, their children had a 50% increased risk for receiving ADHD medication, according to the study. The study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development, citing a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans. The study highlights the importance of not taking a drug's safety during pregnancy for granted. Doctors frequently recommend acetaminophen to pregnant women for treating mild pain, but the study's authors suggest that women may want to avoid using it frequently until more studies have been done. Pregnant women need to weigh the risks, and while acetaminophen is considered a very gentle drug, it is not harmless. Large doses can damage the liver and even kill. The Food and Drug Administration has asked drug companies to limit how much they put into products.

      "Prediction: Bill Cosby was sentenced to three to ten years in prison for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, Andrea Constand, at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. Cosby's defense team made accusations of racism and sexism in statements outside the courthouse, framing their client's downfall as an unjust product of the #MeToo era. Cosby's publicist, Andrew Wyatt, said his client's defeat was part of the \"sex war\" happening in Washington, comparing it to accusations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh that are roiling the capital. Wyatt also called Cosby's trial that resulted in a conviction \"the most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States.\" Cosby's team has repeatedly argued that racism played a role in Cosby's conviction in not-so-subtle terms, calling the April trial a \"public lynching.\" Cosby's spokesperson also made a connection to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying that Cosby and Kavanaugh are victims of \"a sex war\" that is \"going on in Washington today.\" However, there's a strong chance Kavanaugh could be confirmed anyway. Cosby spent his first night behind bars at SCI Phoenix, a new 3,830-bed state prison in suburban Philadelphia. Cosby will serve his sentence at SCI Phoenix in Skippack Township for sexually assaulting a woman at his Cheltenham Township home in 2004. Cosby was declared a \"sexually violent predator\" just before his sentencing, requiring him to receive monthly counseling the rest of his life. The prison at Laurel Highlands opened in 1996, at the site of a former state hospital. At last count, it held nearly 1,600 inmates. However, it was confirmed on Wednesday morning, Cosby would serve his sentence at SCI Phoenix.\n"

Clinton made this clear during interviews in New Zealand, where she is currently on a nearly two-week Asia-Pacific tour. Clinton's comments come after the Democrats' poor showing in the midterms, which has raised questions about who the party may field as its candidate in 2012 and 2016.

      "Prediction: Compassion Over Killing, an animal rights group, has released a video that shows Tyson Foods employees mistreating chickens at facilities in three Virginia counties. The video, which was taken by an undercover investigator for the group in May and June, depicts Tyson employees throwing, punching, and kicking chickens as well as sticking plastic rods through their beaks in a process known as “boning.” Workers also wrung birds’ necks, ran over them with forklifts, and left injured birds in “dead piles” to die. Tyson Foods has fired 10 people who were members of the crew depicted in the video and discontinued the process of “boning” at two of the facilities in the video after its release. The company has also begun retraining all of its live poultry workers on the company's animal welfare policies. This is not the first time that advocates for various animal rights groups have been able to infiltrate Tyson-connected facilities and secretly record footage of workers abusing chickens and cramped living conditions for chickens before they are slaughtered. Tyson Foods has made more than $10 billion in poultry sales last year, and the company says it is now evaluating further steps it can take to ensure animal well-being procedures are being followed throughout its operations. The new video has also spurred Tyson to discontinue the practice of inserting plastic tubes in rooster's beaks, something known as beak modification, that helps chicken growers prevent males from eating females' feed. Compassion Over Killing recently made formal complaints about the abuse to prosecutors and animal control officers in Mecklenburg, Lunenburg, and Buckingham counties. No charges had been filed as of Wednesday.\n"

      "Prediction: Donald Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, was interviewed on CNN about the recent shake-up in Trump's campaign. Cohen insisted that the changes were not a shake-up, but rather a change-up. When asked about Trump's low ratings in the polls, Cohen repeatedly asked \"says who?\" and refused to acknowledge the notion that Trump's campaign had fallen behind that of Hillary Clinton. The interview did little to assure Trump voters that his campaign was back on track. Trump's campaign has recently appointed two new senior campaign officials, including Breitbart News executive chairman, Steve Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway, who is now campaign manager. Hillary Clinton is ahead in most polls, with Clinton leading by double-digits in Virginia and Colorado and also edging Trump in Iowa. However, Trump is winning at least one poll on Wednesday, A Monmouth University poll of Indiana found he was ahead of Clinton by 11 points in the state, 47%-36%. Twitter users are now spamming Cohen, replying \"says who?\" in response to all his tweets. Michael Cohen is Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump. He has been notoriously aggressive defending Trump against media, threatening to sue multiple organizations over stories (including this one). Interestingly, he was a registered Democrat who voted for Barack Obama in 2008.\n"

      "Prediction: A South Carolina Sheriff's deputy, Ben Fields, has been fired after a video of him forcefully removing a student from class went viral online. The incident occurred at Spring Valley High School in Columbia, where Fields was a school resource officer and football coach. The video shows Fields flipping and tossing a black female student across a classroom. The incident led to an internal investigation by the Richland County Sheriff's Department, which concluded that Fields' actions were \"not acceptable\" and that he did not follow proper training and procedure. The department's review of the incident led to Fields' termination. The FBI, the Justice Department, and state law enforcement have opened separate investigations into the incident. The incident began when the student became disruptive in her algebra class and was texting on her phone. Her teacher asked the student to leave, and when she refused, an administrator was called in. Fields was then ordered to the classroom. The incident has sparked outrage, with civil rights groups praising the swift action against Fields. Critics have accused Fields of racial bias, something local officials have so far denied. The incident has also led to calls for stronger training efforts with school resource officers to ensure such an incident doesn't happen again. The president of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP has called for Fields to be charged with assault. The school district officials have also blasted Fields' actions as \"outrageous\" and \"reprehensible,\" and the video itself \"shamefully shocking.\"\n"

      "Prediction: The Lovely Bones, a film adaptation of Alice Sebold's bestselling novel, has been released. Directed by Peter Jackson, the film follows the story of a 14-year-old girl named Susie Salmon who is murdered in 1973 and watches over her family from the \"in-between\" state. The film stars Saoirse Ronan as Susie, Stanley Tucci as the murderer George Harvey, and Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz as Susie's parents. The film has been criticized for its focus on the creepier aspects of the story, which undermines the emotional balance of the film. Despite this, the film has been praised for its imaginative depiction of the afterlife and the performances of its cast, particularly Ronan. The Lovely Bones has been rated PG-13 for mature themes and disturbing violent content. Overall, the film has received mixed reviews from critics, with some finding it to be a hit-and-miss adaptation of the novel.\n"

      "Prediction: The Mexican military is facing yet another scandal over the use of extrajudicial force. A video released by Mexican media outlets appears to show a soldier executing a civilian lying face down in the street with a shot to the back of his head. The video's circulation was quickly followed by condemnation and pledges from the defense department to determine its authenticity and the Attorney General's Office to investigate the May 3 events in the town of Palmarito. The security camera footage first published by Diario Cambio purportedly depicts part of the military's encounter with fuel pipeline thieves that the government said left 10 dead in the central state of Puebla. Fuel theft has long plagued Mexico, but is generating more violence lately as federal authorities crack down. Mexico's treasury secretary said Tuesday the practice costs the country $780 million to $1 billion each year. The military originally said that in the May 3 encounter the thieves used local residents as human shields in an initial ambush on an army patrol. Two soldiers were killed and a third wounded. Reinforcements of 1,000 soldiers and police were sent in and hours later another patrol was ambushed. Two more soldiers were killed along with three attackers. Puebla state officials later said three more attackers had also died. It is unclear if one of those events is depicted in the video released Wednesday. The video shows the driver's door opening and a man stepping out with his back to the camera. At the same time, a second man exits from the rear door on the driver's side and lies down in the street. The driver is briefly illuminated as he steps through the beam of the tail light, then two soldiers rush in from the darkness and the driver quickly gets on the ground beside the other man. A minute later, a soldier pushes a third man from around the back to the front of the car and out of the frame. Seconds later, the man who had gotten out of the back of the vehicle emerges from the darkness and is pushed by a soldier out of the frame in the same direction. Then a soldier grabs the arms of the apparent driver and another soldier takes his legs, and they drag him toward the car's front and deposit him on his back. With apparent difficulty, he rolls over onto his stomach. Six minutes later, the driver remains face down in the street as a soldier holds a rifle in the foreground and two other soldiers stand near the car. Suddenly, a gun and helmet enter the left edge of the frame directly over the unmoving driver and there is a flash from the\n"

      "Prediction: A group of truck drivers, known as \"Truckers for the Constitution,\" are planning to protest the federal government by backing up the Capital Beltway around Washington, D.C. The group is frustrated with the Obama administration's regulations and the overall political climate in the U.S. They plan to call attention to their grievances by intentionally clogging the inner loop of the Washington, D.C., beltway beginning on the morning of Oct. 11. The truckers will circle the beltway \"three lanes deep\" and keep the left lane open for emergency vehicles. The trucks will be going the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit. D.C. commuters who wish to be allowed past the convoy must have \"T2SDA\" – an acronym for the event's original name, \"Truckers to Shut Down America\" – written on their vehicle. The truckers are complaining about their wages, gas prices, and the Obama administration's regulations of their industry. They are also unhappy with reports the U.S. government was spying on American citizens earlier this year and the amount of debt the country has. The truckers cast their protest in stark terms, saying the only way to get legislators to operate lawfully and constitutionally is to penalize them with a credible threat of a shutdown. The truckers are not asking for impeachment, but rather the arrest of everyone in government who has violated their oath of office. They plan to present demands to congressmen, including the impeachment of President Barack Obama, and give the congressmen an opportunity to agree to the demands in exchange for canceling the ride. The truckers' grievances include Environmental Protection Agency fuel efficiency standards and the high cost of diesel fuel. State and local anti-idling laws as well as insurance companies purportedly requiring technological updates are among the irritations, as is the perceived deterioration of Fourth Amendment rights protecting truckers' cabs. Whether or not the truckers pack a punch to D.C. area traffic depends on the number and intensity level of participants. A similar three-day protest in 2007, against illegal immigration and competition from Mexican truckers, did not spoil commutes as feared, the Washington Examiner reported. A Facebook page advertising the upcoming ride has close to 50,000 likes.\n"

      "Prediction: The Secret Service has been embroiled in a scandal involving prostitution in Colombia. Two supervisors, David Chaney and Greg Stokes, have been accused of participating in the misconduct, which included heavy drinking, visits to a strip club, and payments to women working as prostitutes. The incident became public after one man got into a dispute over payment with a woman on the morning of April 12, drawing the attention of hotel staff and Colombian authorities, who reported the matter to the U.S. Embassy. The Secret Service recalled its 11 employees and replaced them with another team before Obama arrived April 13. All of the recalled members were placed on administrative leave, and their top-secret security clearances were revoked. The scandal has raised questions of accountability and personal conduct in an agency whose top leadership has insisted that the Cartagena incident is an isolated and aberrant case, not a sign of a deeper cultural problem within the institution. Members of Congress who have been briefed on the matter have said 21 men are suspected of bringing as many as 21 prostitutes to their rooms. Ten military personnel also have been accused of participating, along with the 11 Secret Service members. The incident has become an election year embarrassment in the U.S. Prostitution is legal in Colombia, and Cartagena thrives on the sex tourism industry, Mayor Campo Elias readily acknowledged, with hundreds of prostitutes available on any given night throughout the colonial walled city. The Secret Service has moved quickly to try to quell the embarrassing episode, forcing out three employees so far, including two supervisors. The supervisors were in the agency's uniformed division; one is a sergeant, according to a person familiar with Secret Service operations who refused to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. Lawrence Berger, general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officials Association, confirmed Thursday he is representing the supervisors, Chaney and Greg Stokes, but said he could not discuss details of the investigation. Berger did not answer questions about his clients' employment status. Berger did not answer questions about his clients' employment status. \"They have a passion for the agency's mission,\" he said. \"They've both been doing it for over 17 or 18 years, day in and day out, and very well.\" Members of Congress who have been briefed on the matter have said 21 men are suspected of bringing as many as 21 prostitutes to their rooms.

House Speaker John Boehner has a powerful incentive to continue to press his party’s fight against the health law: Conservatives in the House Republican conference are clamoring for a confrontation over it, and they have the votes to make trouble for Boehner on this and many other fiscal matters. Republicans argue that their new proposal to delay the health care law for a year represents a compromise between their earlier efforts to repeal it entirely and Democrats’ desire to make no changes in it for now. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been the most ardent proponent of President Barack Obama taking a hard line with House Republicans in the latest fiscal crisis engulfing Washington. Reid is getting his way, and he has taken the lead role in pushing a hardball Democratic legislative strategy that can be summed up like this: Make the Republicans cave. Democrats say they will make sure neither they — nor the White House — will bend. Eventually, they believe, Boehner will be forced to acquiesce to Democratic demands to keep the government funded without any anti-Obamacare provisions. The Washington region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors in the nation, could lose an estimated $200 million a day and could see more than 700,000 jobs take a financial hit if the federal government shuts down Monday night, according to a local economist’s projections. The possible shutdown comes at a time when the region’s economy is weak, said Fuller, the economist. The across-the-board sequestration cuts earlier this year cost the region 26,500 net jobs in August, Fuller said. With furloughs and agencies not filling positions, the $42 billion annual federal payroll is down $2 billion from last year, and federal contracting is down $5 billion. The ripple effects of a shutdown can be devastating, said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.). Congress is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon—close to the midnight deadline for passing legislation to avoid a government shutdown. Democratic leaders could call senators into session on Sunday or earlier on Monday, but aides say they have no plans to do so. Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon—close\n"

      "Prediction: NASA's upcoming mission to study the sun has been renamed the Parker Solar Probe in honor of astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The probe will travel closer to the sun than any spacecraft has ever reached before, with temperatures reaching up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit and solar radiation intensities 475 times greater than on Earth. The mission aims to solve two long-standing puzzles: how the solar wind is accelerated and why the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, is so much hotter than the solar surface. The probe will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying whatever inscription Parker wishes to provide. The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The probe will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion or the closest point to the sun, and will repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025. The 20-day launch window opens on July 31, 2018. It's the first time a spacecraft will be named for a living person.\n"

      "Prediction: The holiday season saw a number of high-profile data breaches, including those at Neiman Marcus and Target. Neiman Marcus disclosed that its computer network had been penetrated by hackers as far back as July, and the breach was not fully contained until Sunday. The company apologized for not disclosing the data theft of customer information sooner, but said it waited to confirm evidence. Neiman has not publicly given any estimate of how many credit card numbers were stolen, or how many customers were affected. The company only publicly acknowledged the data breach last Friday after facing inquiries from a journalist specializing in computer security. \n",
      "\n",
      "A 17-page report from a computer firm hired to look into the massive data breach at Target stores provides new insight into the holiday hacking that endangered data for more than 100 million customers. The report, from computer firm iSight, was filed to the U.S. Secret Service and obtained by NBC News. It details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist. \n",
      "\n",
      "The holiday data breach at Target Corp. appeared to be part of a broad and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers, according to a report prepared by federal and private investigators that was sent to financial-services companies and retailers. The report offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts and 70 million pieces of personal information. \n",

      "Prediction: In Kenya, a male lion named Mohawk was shot dead by wildlife rangers after he attacked a man in a crowd. Mohawk had escaped from Nairobi National Park and was surrounded by hundreds of people. The animal management team that first arrived had no tranquilizers, only rifles. A second team with tranquilizers was on its way, but the first team killed the animal before arriving because he posed an immediate threat to human life. The death of Mohawk sparked an outcry among Kenyans, who used the hashtag #JusticeforMohawk to ask why rangers did not tranquilize him instead. The Kenya Wildlife Service said it is unsure why there is a surge in escapes, but conservationists cite habitat loss as the central reason. Nairobi National Park is home to leopards, buffaloes, giraffes, and other animals grazing in sprawling grasslands -- the city's skyscrapers in the background. It is largely bounded by an electric fence to keep animals inside. However, its south side -- away from the city -- is bordered by a river. It's unclear whether that's the path the lions use to sneak out. In South Africa, a lion named Sylvester had escaped from Karoo National Park. Like in Kenya, wildlife officials said he posed a threat. On Wednesday, they prepared to kill him. This is not the first time Sylvester has strayed away from the park. Conservationists have a reason to try and save the king of the jungle. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the African lion a “vulnerable” species. A study last year found that its population had declined by 50 percent in the past 20 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the news highlights the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century because of unregulated hunting, a loss of habitat, and growing conflict with livestock herders. The cases of African lions on the loose highlight the need for better management of natural resources and infrastructure development. The surge in escapes from Nairobi National Park has raised questions about whether to dart a potentially dangerous predator with a tranquilizer and return it to a fenced area, or kill it before it can attack people. Such decisions depend on factors including the training of wildlife experts, their resources, and whether the area where a lion is roaming is densely populated. In some cases, local residents have killed lions before officials arrived on the scene. \n",

      "Prediction: Archaeologists in Bulgaria have discovered a lead vessel containing ashes from the grave of John the Apostle, one of Jesus' twelve apostles. The vessel was found in a reliquary that dates back to the sixth century C.E. And was once part of an early Christian basilica named for Saint John the Theologian. The vessel is decorated with crosses and is believed to have healing properties. The discovery was made during excavations of the ancient and medieval port of Burgos (or Poros) on Cape Foros in the Black Sea city of Burgas. The reliquary was found in the 6th century basilica and is considered one of the most important discoveries in the history of the Burgas Regional History Museum. The lead tube reliquary is unique because the images on it are identical with the images from a group of clay tube reliquaries produced in ancient Ephesus. The discovery of the lead tube reliquary with ashes from the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus near Burgas resembles another relic discovery from the same region, Bulgaria's Southern Black Sea coast. In 2010, during excavations of an ancient monastery on the St. Ivan (St. John) Island in the Black Sea, off the coast of Bulgaria's Sozopol, just to the north of Burgas, Bulgarian archaeologist Prof. Kazimir Popkonstantinov discovered a reliquary containing relics of St. John the Baptist. The relics of St. John the Baptist, which consist of small bone particles from a skull, jaw bone, arm bone, and tooth, have received lots of international interest in the years since then, and in February 2015 CNN reported that Oxford University scholars had confirmed the possibility of their authenticity by concluding that they belonged to a man who lived in the Middle East at the same time as Jesus Christ. The ancient and medieval fortress and port of Burgos (Poros) is located on the Cape of Foros in the Bulgarian Black Sea city of Burgas. It was first first excavated in 2008 by archaeologists Milen Nikolov (currently Director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History), Dr. Tsonya Drazheva, and Konstantin Gospodinov, after access to its site was denied for decades because of the existence of a nearby military base which has been closed down in recent years. Part of its fortress wall was first discovered in 1989 during the construction of a cow farm. Even though there have been traces of ancient life\n"

      "Prediction: Netflix has announced an unlimited maternity and paternity leave policy for its employees. The company's Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, stated that the policy is part of the company's \"freedom and responsibility\" culture, which aims to give employees the flexibility and confidence to balance their growing families without worrying about work or finances. The policy allows employees to take off as much time as they want during the first year after a child's birth or adoption, and they can return part-time, full-time, or return and then go back out as needed. Netflix will keep paying them normally, eliminating the hassle of having to switch to state or disability pay. The company's continued success hinges on competing for and keeping the most talented individuals in their field, and experience shows that people perform better at work when they're not worrying about home. Netflix's policy deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers, as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging for new parents. However, unlimited time off policies can have their pitfalls, such as employees having to work with their managers and teams ahead of time to make sure their absence won't jeopardize a project or deadline. Extended absences can also strain workplace relations.\n"

The report highlights that data brokers are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of a consumer's data only if it is used for credit, employment, insurance or housing. However, medical privacy laws prohibit doctors from sharing patient information, medical information that data brokers get elsewhere, such as from the purchase of over-the-counter drugs and other health care items, is fair game. The World Privacy Forum uncovered lists of rape victims, seniors with dementia, and people with HIV and AIDS being sold to marketers, highlighting the need for increased government regulations. The report also revealed that some data brokers offer ways to opt out, but many have unclear opt-out procedures or none at all. The Senate committee chairman criticized several of the country's largest data brokers for resisting oversight and said he would continue to push for information on how they get data and who they sell it to.

      "Prediction: Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology have found evidence of a giant icy planet lurking in the darkness of our solar system far beyond the orbit of Pluto. They are calling it \"Planet Nine.\" The planet's mass is estimated to be five to 10 times that of the Earth, but the authors, astronomers Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly. Instead, they have inferred its existence from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. The astronomers suggest it might have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which on average is 20 times farther away than the eighth planet, Neptune. Confirmation of its existence would reconfigure the models of the solar system. The past two decades have seen a burst of discoveries as astronomers have scrutinized the light of distant stars and looked for signs of orbiting planets. More than a thousand such planets have been detected through analysis of starlight that has traveled across the vast interstellar distances. The thought of a hidden planet larger than Earth is intriguing, but for now it's difficult to say too much about the hypothetical conditions there. Brown believes it's probably an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas – a planet that could have been the core of a gas giant had it not been ejected into a wonky, highly elliptical orbit. It might not make its closest approach of the sun more than once every 10,000 years, and even then it would remain far beyond the known planets. The situation mimics what happened in the 19th century when careful observation of the seventh planet, Uranus, indicated that there must be another body in far-distant space influencing its orbit. That work led eventually to the discovery of Neptune. The two know they may not get credit for that discovery. Until the planet is spotted directly with a telescope, any work surrounding it is theoretical. Brown, Batygin and other scientists who have made the case for Planet Nine's existence are providing treasure maps and clues – but someone else could very well strike gold before they do. The New Horizons flyby has renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated into the club of planets from which it was unceremoniously dumped in 2006. But Dr Mike Brown of Caltech in Pasadena, who rejoices in the sobriquet of \"the man who killed Pluto\" told BBC News that those arguing\n"

      "Prediction: The news reports on the aftermath of the Libyan conflict, specifically the search for missing people and the opening of Gaddafi's prisons. Rebel leaders estimate that nearly 60,000 Libyans have disappeared during the six-month-long conflict, and only about 10,000 prisoners have been accounted for. The rebels have opened Gaddafi's prisons in Tripoli, freeing thousands, but many families and friends fear that thousands are in underground prisons or mass graves. One man, Abdul Rauf, was held for 48 days in the notorious Abu Salim facility, where he was beaten and jabbed with electric prods every morning. He shared a small cell with 70 people and told men who had been locked up for years what was happening outside the prison's iron gates and towering walls. When he was finally reunited with his family, he told them that he was beaten and given a small piece of bread, some cheese, and, sometimes, a hard-boiled egg to share among six people. In another report, Muneer Masoud Own, 33, who made a living doing manual labor, said forces loyal to longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi slaughtered nearly 150 prisoners as rebels closed in on Tripoli last week. Charred bodies littered the ground around a warehouse where the detainees were kept. Volunteers said they pulled out at least 150 bodies, the majority of them unrecognizable. Many of the victims may remain unknown, their families left without answers to their fate. The news highlights the human crisis that has arisen from the conflict and the need for answers and closure for families and friends of the missing. \n",

      "Prediction: Recent studies have shown that yo-yo dieting, or repeatedly losing and gaining weight, may have serious health implications for people with coronary heart disease. A new study found that individuals with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than people who experienced little change in body weight. The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that compared with the one-fifth of people with the lowest weight variability, the one-fifth with the highest had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death. The study, sponsored by Pfizer, is in The New England Journal of Medicine. Yo-yo dieting - also known as \"weight cycling\" or the \"yo-yo effect\" - is defined as repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain. The study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, said that the findings suggest that people with coronary heart disease need to be concerned about weight fluctuation and that the data can be used as motivation to keep the weight off. The study's findings raise concerns about weight fluctuation in people with CHD and suggest that further investigation is warranted. \n",

Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in your arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. When plaque builds up, they narrow your coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. Eventually, the decreased blood flow may cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack. Because coronary artery disease often develops over decades, you might not notice a problem until you have a significant blockage or a heart attack. But there's plenty you can do to prevent and treat coronary artery disease. A healthy lifestyle can make a big impact. Coronary artery disease care at Mayo Clinic. \n",

      "Prediction: A 3-year-old girl from Hawaii named Finley Puleo Boyle died after a dental procedure in December 2013. The medical examiner's autopsy report concluded that the sedatives and local anesthesia given to her during the procedure were partly to blame for her death. Finley had been undergoing root canal treatment at Dr. Lilly Geyer's office at Island Dentistry for Children in Kailua. The report stated that the girl had no signs of underlying heart problems or an allergic reaction to the sedatives and anesthetic she received. However, immediately after the lidocaine injection, Finley became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest. The medical examiner classified the death as an accident. Finley's parents filed a negligence lawsuit while their daughter was in a coma. The lawsuit alleges that the girl wasn't monitored while she was sedated, and instead of checking her oxygen levels every five minutes, it wasn't done for 26 minutes. The medical examiner's office ultimately ruled the death an accident. No criminal charges have been brought against Geyer. In January 2014, new state rules took effect tightening oversight of dental sedation in Hawaii.\n"

      "Prediction: O.J. Simpson was granted parole after serving nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for an armed robbery and kidnapping conviction. Simpson apologized for his role in the 2007 armed robbery, said he'd been a model prisoner, and promised that he'd have no conflicts if released. The parole hearing garnered wall-to-wall coverage from cable news shows, recalling the \"trial of the century\" and the many months more than 20 years ago when it transfixed a nation. Simpson has served nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for an armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas. He is expected to be released as early as October -- and said he plans to move to his home in Florida. An entire generation of Americans has come of age since Simpson seemed an almost inescapable public figure. But for one afternoon, it felt like 1995 again. That was the year he was acquitted of murder charges in the grisly slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. Thursday's parole hearing followed renewed interest in his story, which was explored last year in the award-winning documentary \"O.J.: Made in America\" and the FX true-crime drama \"The People v. O.J. Simpson.\" Though it's been 22 years since the not guilty verdict, the murder trial's themes of criminal justice and race, trust in police, celebrity and domestic violence remain remarkably resonant in modern culture. Parole board vote unanimous. Simpson smiled, said \"thank you,\" and then put his head down for a few moments silently. O.J. Simpson wins parole after serving nine years for armed robbery and kidnapping. 'My best friend' Simpson said in closing remarks that he had been a peacemaker in the prison and had been a model prisoner. Simpson also said he has taken two \"Alternative to Violence\" classes, which he said was \"the most important course any person in this prison can take.\" In addition, robbery victim Bruce Fromong testified that he had forgiven Simpson for the crime at that Las Vegas hotel room, and advocated for his release. Simpson had also been described by authorities as a model prisoner at Lovelock Correctional Center, a medium-security prison in the Nevada desert. The robbery Simpson and an associate were convicted of kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon for attempting to steal pieces of Simpson sports memorabilia at gunpoint.

      "Prediction: President Donald Trump held a free-flowing news conference on Thursday to defend his administration and decry what he called \"fake news\" stories about his associates' ties to Russia. Trump used the event to try to claw his young administration back from the brink after a defeat in court and the forced resignation of his top national security adviser. He taunted reporters and waved away their attempts to fact-check him in real time. He (incorrectly) touted his Electoral College total and repeatedly blasted his November opponent — somehow mentioning Hillary Clinton more than anyone else in his defense of his administration's early days. Trump blamed the media for his woes, rebuffing suggestions that he was undermining confidence in the press or threatening the First Amendment by trying to convince the nation that \"the press honestly is out of control.\" Trump had put claims of press prejudice at the center of his campaign in an unprecedented way and earlier this month falsely accused the media of refusing to cover terrorist attacks across the world. Trump's first solo news conference as president has no rivals in recent memory. For all the trappings of the White House and traditions of the forum, his performance was one of a swaggering, blustery campaigner, armed with grievances and primed to unload on his favorite targets. Trump went even further, blaming the media for all but sinking his not-yet-launched attempt to \"make a deal\" with Moscow. Trump accused the political press of being dishonest and suggested that any negative coverage of his administration was \"fake news.\" He unloaded a torrent of grievances while positioning himself as the stand-in for the everyman, who, he declared, hates and distrusts reporters as much as he does. Trump's performance was vintage Trump, a throwback to the messy, zinger-filled news conferences he held during the early stages of his campaign. And, when combined with a rally slated for Saturday in Florida, it appeared to be the start of a one-two punch meant to re-energize a president whose White House in recent days has been buffeted by crisis and paralyzed by dysfunction. Trump was eager to assign blame elsewhere, ignoring the nation's healthy economy and relative peace when he took office to say \"to be honest, I inherited a mess, a mess, at home and abroad, a mess.\" Trump mostly blamed the media for his woes, rebuffing suggestions that he was undermining confidence in the press or threatening the First Amendment by trying to convince the nation that \"the press honestly is out of control.\" Trump had put claims of press prejudice at the center\n"

      "Prediction: NASA has announced that urgent repairs are needed on the International Space Station due to a problem with one of its cooling systems. The situation does not represent a life-threatening emergency, but it has required a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost. The problem is one of the \"Big 14\" maintenance issues that NASA and its partners expect to face on an occasional basis during space station operations. The crew was never in any danger, but they had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab. Engineers think the problem was caused by a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant. Mission managers are trying to determine whether a software fix can get the valve working again, or whether a spacewalk will be required. Sorting through all the issues might take a couple of days, or as much as a couple of weeks. The station and crew aboard were never in any danger, NASA said. Officials could determine that an emergency spacewalk is the best way to fix the failed pump -- something they've done in the past. The current mission of the space station, officially called Expedition 38, is scheduled to go until March 2014. The six-person crew consists of NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins and Rick Mastracchio of the United States; Russians Mikhail Tyurin, Sergey Ryazanskiy, and Oleg Kotov; and Koichi Wakata of Japan. The external cooling loops are systems that circulate ammonia outside the station to keep equipment cool. Officials discovered the malfunctioning loop was producing too much ammonia Wednesday morning, NASA spokesman Josh Byerly said. Teams have shut down some non-critical systems on the station as a result of the problem, NASA said. The space station's life support system is still up and running.

      "Prediction: The Australian radio hosts who made a prank call to a London hospital treating Prince William's wife Kate have expressed their heartbreak at hearing that a nurse had been found dead. Mel Greig and Michael Christian from Sydney station 2Day FM have been in hiding and undergoing counselling since their hoax sparked global outrage following the apparent suicide of Jacintha Saldanha. In interviews on Australian television, the pair broke their silence following Saldanha's death last week in London, as 2Day FM's owner said it was cancelling their show and stopping all hoax calls by its broadcasters. An emotional Greig said she was devastated on hearing the Indian-born nurse had died. \"Unfortunately I remember that moment very well because I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened,\" she told Australia's Seven Network. \"And I remember my first question was, was she a mother?\" In a separate interview with the Nine Network, Greig added: \"It came into my head that I just wanted to reach out to them (the family), give them a big hug and say sorry. I hope they're okay, I really do.\" The call, with Greig and Christian posing as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles, was taken by mother-of-two Saldanha, 46, at London's King Edward VII Hospital. With no receptionist on duty in the early morning, she put them through to a colleague who divulged details of the pregnant Kate's recovery from severe morning sickness. Saldanha was subsequently found dead, although British police have refused to confirm whether it was suicide pending an inquest. Christian said he too was devastated. \"Shattered, gutted, heartbroken and obviously you know... our deepest sympathies are with the family and the friends,\" he told Nine. \"We just hope that her family and friends are as good as they can be and that they are getting the love and support they deserve.\" The death sparked an outpouring of fury against the radio station and the presenters, although the broadcaster Monday said no one could have foreseen the tragic consequences of what the hospital says was an \"appalling\" stunt. Rhys Holleran, chief executive of Southern Cross Austereo, which owns 2Day FM, said the station called the hospital five times to discuss what it had recorded before going to air. He said he was satisfied that the appropriate checks were conducted before the pre-recorded segment was broadcast. The segment was subject to an internal review, including with 2Day FM's lawyers\n"

      "Prediction: North Korea is believed to be moving an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), according to a South Korean lawmaker who was briefed by the country's intelligence service. The lawmaker said it was unclear when the movement was detected, what the direction of the projectile was, and how it was being transported. The news comes after North Korea's sixth test of a nuclear weapon, which seismological data indicated was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation, nuclear experts said. North Korean state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. North Korea has test-fired a number of missiles this summer, including two long-range ones in July and an intermediate-range one in August that overflew the Japanese island of Hokkaido. South Korea's Navy conducted a live-fire drill in the waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's Sunday nuclear test. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, spoke by phone Monday and agreed to lift current restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles. However, signs of a rift between the two leaders have become apparent despite the decades-long alliance between Seoul and Washington.

      "Prediction: On Thursday, a tragic incident occurred in Schertz, Texas, where a 6-year-old boy named Kameron Prescott was fatally shot by a stray bullet during a deputy-involved shooting. The incident happened at the Pecan Grove Mobile Home Park on FM 78, where Kameron lived with his family. According to Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar, four deputies fired shots outside the home when a woman who they believed was armed with a gun appeared to be reaching for the weapon. The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Amanda Lene Jones, was a wanted felon and car-theft suspect. Jones had physically forced her way into Kameron's home, threatened to shoot members of his family, and said she was taking their vehicle. When Jones left the home, the deputies were outside, waiting. Witnesses heard the woman threaten to shoot the law enforcement officers. The deputies saw her holding something in her hand, which they believed was a weapon. Jones had no apparent ties to the boy or his relatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "The deputies who opened fire, identified as John Aguillon, George Herrera, Jesse Arias, and Johnny Longoria, a reservist, have been placed on administrative leave. The local district attorney is investigating. Parts of the shooting were captured by a body camera worn by one deputy, but the view was obstructed when the deputy raised his rifle to fire. The school district's website reported Kameron's death, and the district has established a fund to assist Kameron's family with expenses. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kameron's first-grade teacher, Shanda Ince, described him as a kind soul who loved to make everyone laugh. School counselor Maria Morales said Kameron was \"a kind soul.\" Jones' criminal history included at least 13 arrests on charges ranging from drug possession to burglary. Rhonda Campbell, who also lives in the Pecan Grove Mobile Home Park, told KSAT that Jones had kicked in her door that morning. She described Jones as \"desperate, maybe on drugs.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "The incident began when a deputy responding to a report of a stolen vehicle spotted Jones with what he thought was a weapon. Jones, on several occasions, \"physically threatened him with that weapon and verbalized to him that she intended to shoot him with that weapon,\" the sheriff said. Jones managed to get away, and deputies did not see her again until a couple of hours later, when she turned up at the mobile home park where Kameron lived. \n",

      "Prediction: A vegan mother in Seminole County, Florida, was arrested in June for refusing to take her newborn son to the hospital because she believed that the formula prescribed by the doctor contained animal by-products. The baby was taken into state custody and placed in a foster home. However, the mother regained custody of the child after a judge ruled that there was no case of abuse or neglect. The judge also dismissed the criminal case against the mother. The baby is now healthy and thriving on a soy formula. The incident highlights the challenges faced by parents who choose alternative diets for their children. It also raises questions about the role of doctors in making decisions about a child's health and nutrition. The case has sparked a debate about the rights of parents to make choices for their children's health and the responsibility of doctors to respect those choices. Ultimately, the case underscores the importance of communication and collaboration between parents and doctors to ensure the best possible outcomes for children's health and well-being.\n"

      "Prediction: Colorectal cancer is often thought to affect primarily older men, but a recent study has shown that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients is younger than 50. The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, analyzed data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011. The results suggest that the medical community needs to be more aware of the signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50. Younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. The study raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. The researchers believe that their work is a wake-up call to the medical community, which should be looking for the signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50. The study also found that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50. The report was published online in the journal Cancer. \n",

      "Prediction: Archaeologists have discovered a human settlement dating back 49,000 years in a rock shelter in southern Australia. The discovery was made by chance when archaeologist Giles Hamm was surveying the territory in Flinders Ranges with aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard. The site, known as Warratyi rock-shelter, contains evidence of human interaction with mega fauna, namely the Diprotodon optatum - a marsupial measuring 2m in height and weighing more than 2,500kg. The presence of bones from juvenile animals in a cave on a cliff suggests they were hunted, said Gavin Prideaux, palaeontologist at Flinders University in South Australia. The site also contains the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna. The artefacts excavated at the site also push back the earliest-known dates on the development of key bone and stone axe technologies and the use of ochre in Australia. The timing of the human settlement shows people moved through central Australia and used key technologies such as stone axes and ochre much earlier than previously thought. The site, which is a newly discovered cave in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, is significant because it challenges certain assumptions that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in on the globe. The discovery is also important because it provides evidence of how widespread the Indigenous Australians were within just 1,000 years of hitting the coast. The study has been published in Nature.\n"

      "Prediction: Israel's Operation Protective Edge has been ongoing for 24 days, with the security cabinet ordering the military to continue the offensive in the Gaza Strip, focusing on the destruction of Hamas' tunnel network. An Israeli delegation traveled to Cairo for talks over Egypt's efforts to broker a truce in Gaza. The death toll in the Israeli operation has topped 1,360 according to Palestinian health officials, with more than 6,500 Palestinians wounded. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has declared Gaza a \"humanitarian disaster area\" and urged the international community to protect and provide relief to the battered enclave. In a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, he accused Israel of committing war crimes. The UN representative in Jerusalem, Robert Serry, has \"received assurances\" that all parties have agreed to a pause, according to a joint statement released by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and United States Secretary of State John Kerry. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a 72-hour ceasefire in their conflict in the Gaza Strip starting on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday. The ceasefire will begin at 8 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) on Friday, they said in a joint statement. The statement said \"forces on the ground will remain in place\" during the truce, implying that Israeli ground forces will not withdraw. Israel will be required under international law to take responsibility for helping Palestinian civilians if there are any further large-scale displacements from the fighting in Gaza, UNRWA chief Pierre Krähenbühl tells the United Nations Security Council. The UN's top human rights official is accusing Israel and Hamas militants of committing war crimes in the latest Gaza war. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay says that by placing and firing rockets within heavily populated areas both sides are committing \"a violation of international humanitarian law, therefore a war crime.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel will destroy the Hamas tunnel network in the Gaza Strip \"with or without a cease-fire,\" as the military called up another 16,000 reservists to pursue its campaign in the densely-populated territory. Israeli attacks in the strip continued Thursday, with witnesses saying that munitions struck the Omar Ibn al-Khatab mosque next to a U.N. school in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. Israeli fire near another U.N. school in Gaza killed more than a dozen people the day before, drawing international condemnation. The strike in Beit Lahiya early Thursday damaged\n"

      "Prediction: Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, has made its Spectacles available for purchase online in the US. The $130 glasses allow users to take circular videos and post them to their Snapchat accounts. Previously, the glasses were only available through vending machines in major metro areas and a store in Manhattan. The limited supply of the glasses led to long lines and high demand, with some people waiting for hours to get their hands on a pair. However, Snap has now opened up the glasses for purchase on its website, and they are available in three colors: teal, coral, and black. The purchase limit is six pairs, and buyers should expect to wait two to four weeks for their Spectacles to ship. Pop-up vending machines around the country will also remain a part of Snap's distribution strategy. Despite the positive response to Spectacles, Snap admitted in its IPO filing that \"The launch of Spectacles... has not generated significant revenue for us,\" and notes \"We expect to experience production and operating costs related to Spectacles that will exceed the related revenue in the near future.\" Despite this, Snap hopes to prove to investors that Spectacles can earn money for its business, not just be a brand stunt. The company's next move is to release a new camera, which could bolster confidence in its public offering.\n"

The steps involve harvesting all of a planet's resources, harvesting all of a nearest star's energy, and harvesting all the energy from all the stars in a local galaxy before moving on to another galaxy. The article also mentions that harvesting energy from distant stars isn't just the best way to increase a civilization's available resources, but it's also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization totally alone in the vastness of space. The article also mentions that any advanced civilization worth their starships would understand the grim reality of universal expansion and wouldn't just sit around idly while the universe literally passed them by. They would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy first before those stars and their energy become inaccessible forever. \n",

Dyson realized that alien civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation. Dyson proposed that really advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems, perhaps dismantling planets to form a shell of satellites around their star to capture its energy. The article also mentions that a solid shell around a star would be gravitationally unstable, and would probably require more material than all of the planets of a solar system could provide. Instead, practical Dyson spheres would be made from millions of individual solar-collecting satellites. The article also mentions that solar sails could remain in place by balancing against the pressure of light from the sun. The satellite would not be in orbit, it would actually hover in space. Such a satellite is called a \"statite\n"

      "Prediction: On Tuesday, a Disneyland employee named Christian Barnes was arrested for allegedly placing a so-called dry ice bomb in a trash can in the park's Toontown section. The explosion caused some brief chaos in a portion of Disneyland popular with young children, but no one was injured. Barnes, who worked as an outdoor vendor for the resort, was held on $1 million bail and is cooperating with investigators. Detectives found fragments of a water bottle in the trash can and believe Barnes placed dry ice inside it to create the explosion. The dry ice appeared to have been placed in a plastic bottle that was left in a trash can in Toontown. The explosion was confined to the can, according to the Anaheim Police Department. The incident did not cause any significant damage, and it does not appear to be connected to similar dry-ice explosions in Anaheim in recent months. Disneyland briefly evacuated the Mickey's Toontown section where the incident occurred. The resort is working closely with authorities to investigate the incident. \n",

      "Prediction: Former Winnipeg broadcast personality and Red River College journalism instructor Steve Vogelsang has been charged with two counts of robbery involving two separate banks in Alberta. Vogelsang worked as a news director and longtime sports anchor at CTV Winnipeg, beginning in the early 1990s. He became a journalism instructor at Red River College in 2002 and resigned in 2011. In March, a former student he had dated was granted a protection order against him. Vogelsang is accused of harassing the former student, who alleges that he did not stop contacting her through text, emails, and voicemails, despite Winnipeg police asking him on three occasions to leave her alone. Vogelsang is also dealing with criminal charges in Winnipeg, including charges of sexual assault and disobeying a court order. Court documents obtained by CTV News detail his divorce, including accusations of missing mortgage payments and borrowing money. Vogelsang is expected to appear in court tomorrow. Former students of Vogelsang expressed shock and disbelief at the allegations. \n",

      "Prediction: Oakleigh Ryan Nance, an 11-month-old girl, is fighting for her life in a metro hospital after being diagnosed with a critical case of E. coli. She was born premature and spent a lot of time in the NICU, but seemed to be in perfect health for six months before contracting a bacterial infection. The family doesn't know how she contracted the infection, but investigators with the CDC are looking into the case. Oakleigh has already had so many antibiotics for previous health issues, and the family is running out of options. The real problem that Oakleigh faces is the fact that at such a young age, she's been exposed to so many antibiotics. The E. coli she has is resistant to a lot of antibiotics that are out there. Oakleigh's kidney surgery is scheduled for the second week in August, and her family is trying to raise money through a GoFundMe account to cover those medical expenses. Despite the challenges, Oakleigh's family remains hopeful and sustained by their faith in God. \n",

      "In related news, a pseudomonas infection is caused by a very common type of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Healthy people often carry these bacteria around without knowing it and without having any problems. However, for people who are weak or ill, these germs can cause very serious-even deadly-infections in any part of the body. Pseudomonas infections are hard to treat because the bacteria can resist many types of antibiotics, the medicines normally used to kill bacteria. People in the hospital may get this infection, and it can spread through medical equipment, cleaning solutions, and other equipment. Burn victims and people with puncture wounds may get dangerous pseudomonas infections of the blood, bone, or urinary tract. The bacteria can also get into the body through IV needles or catheters. These bacteria like moist environments, such as hot tubs and swimming pools, where they can cause a skin rash or swimmer's ear. People who wear contact lenses can get serious eye infections if the bacteria get into their contact lens solutions. This can happen if you aren't careful about keeping your contact lenses and equipment sterile. Symptoms depend on where the infection is, but all pseudomonas infections can make you very sick if they spread through the bloodstream (septicemia). A serious infection can cause symptoms of high fever, chills, confusion, and shock. \n",

      "Prediction: The news revolves around a man named Dallas Swonger who was caught on video urinating in a city reservoir in Portland. The incident prompted officials to flush 38 million gallons of drinking water down the drain, even though test results showed no signs of water contamination. Swonger insists that he did not urinate in the drinking supply, but rather on the wall next to it. The city's decision to dump the water has drawn criticism from national and international news media, with some questioning the need to flush so much water. The incident has also led to speculation about whether the water board proposed in a May ballot measure would feel the same way. Swonger is now facing additional charges and is worried about the impact the incident will have on his reputation. The whole ordeal has left Swonger rattled, and his mother has urged him not to do anything stupid.

The two countries have also agreed to form a joint North and South Korean women's ice hockey team for the Games. North Korea will send a delegation of more than 400, including 230 cheerleaders, 140 artists, and 30 Taekwondo players for a demonstration. The precise number of athletes will be hammered out after discussions with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) scheduled for later this week. Prior to the Games, the sides will carry out joint training for skiers at the North’s Masik Pass resort and a cultural event at the Mount Kumgang resort. North Korea will also send a 150-strong delegation to the Paralympics. The North Korean delegation will begin arriving in South Korea on January 25. The move comes as the countries announced they will field a joint women's ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics in February. The North will send a 550-member delegation to the games, which includes 230 cheerleaders, 140 artists, and 30 taekwondo players for a demonstration. They will begin arriving in South Korea on January 25. The Unification Flag features a blue silhouette of the peninsula and outlying islands. The two countries have marched under the flag before, in rare shows of unity, first at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships, and at a number of sporting events since. It was most recently used at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy. The International Olympics Committee (IOC) would need to approve the countries' agreements, and those that affect competition, such as the joint hockey team, could be more complicated than the ceremonial proposals. Diplomatic thaw between North and South Korea has been ongoing since talks began between the two countries earlier this month, after years of broken communications. However, Japan urged caution over the North’s “charm offensive”. North Korea has remained adamant throughout this month's thaw in relations with South Korea that its nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles are here to stay. North Korea has refused to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States in spite of increasingly severe U.N. sanctions, raising fears of a new war on the Korean peninsula. The North has fired test-fired missiles over Japan. Despite a slight thawing of tensions, Japan has warned that the world should not be naive about the North's \"charm offensive\".

The incident was broadcast live on CNN's \"John King USA\" program, which was produced from the North Lawn of the White House. After the man jumped the fence, armed officers ordered him to lie down and then handcuffed him before taking him into custody. A backpack thrown over the fence and lying on the ground nearby was being checked by security officers, who locked down the area as a precaution. The incident ended shortly after 9 p.m. ET when authorities issued an all-clear directive at the White House. Crudup will be charged with unlawful entry and contempt of court because he previously had been ordered to stay away from the White House due to past incidents, the agency said. This is not the first time someone has attempted to breach the White House fence, as a 6-year-old girl reached the lawn Sunday night by going not over the fence but through it.

      "Prediction: The article discusses the history of The Daily Show, a satirical news program that premiered on Comedy Central in 1996. The show was originally hosted by Craig Kilborn, but was taken over by Jon Stewart in 1999. Stewart brought in new writers and correspondents, including Ben Karlin and Stephen Colbert, who became major figures in the creative life of the show. The show's tone and point of view began to shift when Stewart and his colleagues started covering the 2000 presidential campaign. They realized that they didn't have to integrate themselves with the political media's process to parody them, and instead focused on deconstructing the process. The article also mentions the show's early struggles with finding its direction and tone, as well as its use of eccentric characters in field pieces. However, the breakthrough moment came when Steve Carell asked Senator John McCain a question that forced him to go off-book, and the show began to focus on making fun of journalistic tropes.

She made sure to provide for her beloved dog, Sophie, by setting aside $10,000 for the care of the Papillon. Bacall's will, signed last fall, also remembered two of her employees - Ilsa Hernandez was left $15,000 and Maria Santos was given $20,000. Bacall left $250,000 to each of her six grandchildren, and the rest of her sizable estate - including her apartment in the famed Dakota building - is to be split between her three children. Bacall's estate is comprised of her co-op apartment, royalties, tangibly personal property, cash, and the remainder of a trust ex-husband Humphrey Bogart left her. Bacall's will also requested that her children respect her wish to keep certain personal letters, writings, diaries, and other papers or memorabilia private. Bacall's legacy includes two Tony Awards, a Golden Globe, and an honorary Oscar over her eight-decade career. She got her big break at age 19, when she was cast in Howard Hawks' classic \"To Have and Have Not,\" opposite the much older Bogart.

The violations were related to home renovations conducted without adequate lead paint protections as depicted on the television program Fixer Upper. Magnolia will take steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects, address lead-based paint hazards at high-risk homes in Waco, Texas, and educate the public to lead-based paint hazards and appropriate renovation procedures. The settlement includes relief focused in three areas: compliance management of Magnolia’s own renovation operations, outreach about lead-based paint safety to Magnolia’s national audience, and the reduction of lead-based paint hazards in Magnolia’s local community. Magnolia will pay a civil penalty of $40,000 and produce an educational video highlighting the dangers of lead-based paint within 90 days. The couple has also agreed to spend $160,000 on a lead-abatement project in their hometown of Waco, Texas. The project will reduce the risk of exposure to lead-based paint in at-risk residences by replacing windows and doors, removing lead-based paint and dust, and replacing lead-based paint surfaces and fixtures, among other chores.

      "Prediction: Scientists have discovered evidence of advanced behaviors in the African Stone Age that occurred much earlier than previously thought. The oldest innovations were axes designed to be held in the palm of the hand, which were shaped like a tear drop, with a rounded end and a pointed eye. These axes were great at chopping down branches or chopping up the carcass of a large animal. The oldest stone tools discovered in the Olorgesailie region of southern Kenya are characteristic of what's called the Acheulian culture of the Early Stone Age and consisted mostly of the hand axes. The researchers found that the next technological revolution, marking the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, happened tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. The researchers think that long periods of stress from repeated earthquakes and cycles of drought and heavy rains may have pushed these early humans to partner up with neighboring communities to come up with ways to cope. The team was digging in a region called Olorgesailie in southern Kenya, an area filled with layers of sediment dating back 1.2 million years. The oldest stone tools discovered there are characteristic of what's called the Acheulian culture of the Early Stone Age and consisted mostly of the hand axes. The researchers found numerous smaller, flatter, sharper stone tools. These tools were designed for specific purposes, such as blades, scrapers, or spear heads. The scientists report their findings in three new studies published in the journal Science. The new studies also show that by 320,000 years ago, this technology was well established in the region, suggesting that human ancestors likely started developing it even earlier. The diversity of stone tools from the Middle Stone Age suggests advanced thinking and planning. The researchers also found evidence of exchange of brightly colored red and black rocks that were then drilled into, possibly to extract pigment. This is the earliest evidence of the extraction of pigments, and it's also evidence of a complex culture, where the ancient humans probably used pigments symbolically, perhaps to paint themselves, or their hides, or weapons. The beginning of the Middle Stone Age in Kenya was preceded by a long and tumultuous phase in the region. Human populations needed to adapt or go extinct. The crux of these papers is that hominin populations did not disappear – so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering and sharing, and innovation. The discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin suggest expanded social networks, transmission of information and technological innovation. The \"human revolution\" that\n"

      "Prediction: Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has been speaking out about gun control in the wake of the shooting at an Oregon community college that left nine dead. Trump has previously cited mental health issues, not guns, as the biggest cause of shootings in the US. However, his comments on Saturday are his most extensive and emotionally charged about firearms since he launched his campaign in June. Trump has a license to carry a gun in New York and believes that if someone attacks him, he will respond. He also believes that the gun laws have nothing to do with the shooting and that mental illness is the biggest cause. Trump has also defended his newly introduced tax plan, which independent economists estimate will cost $12tn over 10 years, by noting his ability to cut costs. He pointed to transportation as one place where he could save money. Trump also hit back when NBC’s Chuck Todd pointed to polls which have him losing by a landslide to both vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders in any such general election matchup. Trump believes that he himself would save a significant amount of money under his tax plan, but claims that the major tax cut in his plan would hurt him financially. \n",

      "In a rare sit-down interview, for broadcast on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Trump told Chuck Todd: “I have to say, no matter what you do, you’re gonna have problems. Because you have sick people. They happen to be intelligent. And, you know, they can be sick as hell and they’re geniuses in a certain way. They are going to be able to break the system.” Trump also defended his newly introduced tax plan, which independent economists estimate will cost $12tn over 10 years, by noting his ability to cut costs.

      "Prediction: Kanye West, a famous rapper and fashion icon, has revealed that he is $53 million in debt. He has asked for financial help from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google co-founder Larry Page. Despite his wealth, he claims that without the help of his fans, his true genius cannot be realized. A GoFundMe page has been set up by a Kanye fan in Minnesota to help him pay off his debts. The page has raised $50 so far, which is only 0.000094 percent of Kanye's total debt. Another GoFundMe campaign was organized by Robert Kulik in Washington, D.C., but it was canceled. Kanye's financial struggles have also led him to go on a bizarre Twitter rant, pleading for the two tech billionaires to invest $1 billion in his ideas. Despite his financial troubles, Kanye has recently released his latest album, \"The Life of Pablo,\" and debuted his latest clothing collection at Fashion Week in New York. The album was released on the struggling music streaming app Tidal and was pulled down shortly after it appeared. Kanye has also been accused of taking credit for pop star Taylor Swift's fame. Swift responded to the accusations while accepting a Grammy for best album, advising young women to focus on their work and not let others sidetrack them.\n"

      "Prediction: The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 continues with the Chinese ship Haixun 01 picking up a pulse signal in the southern Indian Ocean. The signal has a frequency of 37.5kHz, which is the same as those emitted by the flight recorders. However, there is no evidence yet that it is linked to MH370. The search is now in its most intensive phase before the batteries on the data recorders fade. Two Chinese ships are in the area, and the head of the Australian agency co-ordinating the search said the reported signals \"are consistent with the aircraft black box\" but \"there is no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft\". The flight is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, although no confirmed debris has been found. The search area is about 217,000 sq km (84,000 sq miles) and has been picked on the basis of analysis of the satellite data. Two ships searching the area have underwater locator capabilities. The search is race against time as the battery-powered signal fades after 30 days. Malaysia has set up three ministerial committees to help co-ordinate the search, and a new investigation team which would include members from Australia, China, the US, the UK and France. Despite the promising lead, caution is necessary as there have been many apparently promising leads over the past few weeks that have turned into nothing.\n"

He recently tweeted that his social media use is \"modern day presidential,\" despite criticism from some Republicans. Trump's tweets have repeatedly sparked controversy, including his recent tweet showing him body-slamming and punching a person signifying CNN. Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert defended the tweet, saying that no one would perceive it as a threat. However, CNN contributor Ana Navarro criticized Bossert's defense, saying that the tweet is an incitement to violence and that Trump's tweets will get someone killed in the media. Trump's tweets have also been criticized for being beneath the dignity of the presidential office. Despite the criticism, Trump continues to use social media to communicate directly with the American people. \n",

      "Prediction: Apple's latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models have been released without a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, which has caused controversy among users. Marketing chief Phil Schiller explained that the decision was made out of \"courage\" to move on and do something better for all of us. However, many users have criticized the decision, calling it \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" and \"stupidity.\" The lack of a headphone jack means that users cannot charge their phone and listen to music at the same time, unless they use an expensive and unwieldy dongle. The decision has also affected other devices that plug into the phone's headphone jack, such as credit card dongles and personal breathalyzers. Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack has been compared to San Francisco's treatment of the middle class. The old Apple mantra of \"it just works\" is now officially dead, as users can no longer use any set of headphones with their iPhone without using a dongle. Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack has caused a large amount of pure rage among users.\n"

      "Prediction: United Airlines has updated its boarding process to reduce congestion and speed up passenger loading. The new boarding process has been in the works for months and has been tested in a handful of test gates in Chicago and Houston. The airline will now use two lanes for boarding instead of five, with elite and other priority passengers in group 1 and 2 loading through lane 1, while customers in group 3, 4, and 5 will use lane 2. The airline is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app, which will be particularly useful if a flight is delayed or if the ground crew decides to load the aircraft early. United has reached an agreement with Compañía Panameña de Aviación S.A. (Copa), Aerovías del Continente Americano S.A. (Avianca) and many of Avianca's affiliates, for a joint business agreement (JBA) that, pending government approval, is expected to provide substantial benefits for customers, communities, and the marketplace for air travel between the United States and 19 countries in Central and South America. The JBA represents an innovative, best-in-class new product offering that will make competition in this robust market even stronger. United has also debuted a new boarding process in an effort to combat overcrowding at gates. The airline has reduced the boarding lines to two from five and is urging travelers to wait until their boarding group is called. United has become the latest airline to tweak the way it calls passengers to board its planes. The new system has been in affect at Los Angeles International Airport since February and will now roll out to all United locations beginning Tuesday. United's changes hint at the struggle airlines have had in creating a boarding process that doesn't stress out customers. Even with precisely delineated groups and queues, many travelers still feel compelled to stand in line to hold their spot. United said customer feedback helped push it to come up with a new system. One big challenge that could remain for United is how its elite-level frequent-flyers will sort themselves out in the updated process.\n"

      "Prediction: Hurricane Irene is expected to hit the East Coast of the United States, causing widespread damage and power outages. The storm has already caused damage in the Bahamas, and officials in North Carolina have issued mandatory evacuation orders for coastal areas. New York City officials have advised residents to stay out of parks and low-lying areas, and some hospitals and nursing homes have been evacuated. The storm is expected to make landfall along North Carolina's Outer Banks on Saturday, and could inundate the state's coastal areas with 6 to 10 inches of rain. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has established depots for emergency supplies in North Carolina, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. The storm is so big and powerful that severe road flooding and widespread electrical outages are likely, especially in the Northeast, where the ground is saturated from recent rains. The hurricane center warned of tidal surges 5 to 10 feet high in North Carolina, accompanied by \"destructive and life-threatening waves.\" Projections show Irene making landfall between Morehead City, N.C., and Cape Hatteras before pushing north. The storm could cause $13.9 billion in insured losses and $20 billion in overall economic losses due to lost hours at work, power outages, interruption of shipping and airline traffic. The last hurricane to strike the U.S. was Ike in 2008, a Category 2 storm when it went ashore near Galveston, Texas. The most recent major hurricane, one with winds of at least 111 mph, was Wilma in 2005. The storm has forced the postponement of the dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial on the National Mall in Washington, which was scheduled for August 28. The hurricane center warned the Bahamas would experience storm surges of as much as 11 feet above sea level and that up to 12 inches of rain may fall. Irene is ripping through the Bahamas with winds of 115 miles per hour, damaging homes, felling trees and triggering flooding, according to the Bahamas Emergency Management Agency. The U.S. Navy moved 64 ships away from Norfolk, Virginia, to keep them from being damaged by the storm, the Associated Press reported. The storm is forecast to turn north into the U.S. on a path similar to 1985’s Hurricane Gloria, threatening as much as $13.9 billion in insured losses and possibly forcing the evacuation of parts of New York City, officials and forecasters said. The hurricane center warned of tidal surges 5 to 10 feet\n"

      "Prediction: Miami Gardens Police Chief Stephen Johnson was arrested for soliciting a prostitute in Dania Beach. He was immediately fired from his position. Johnson was arrested as part of an undercover sting operation by the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. He had called the number on an escort ad on Backpage.com and arranged to pay $100 for a threesome. When he arrived at the hotel room, he was let in and handed over the $100. He had two condoms in his pocket when he was arrested. Johnson was well-liked and respected by the rank and file, but his arrest has again thrust the police department into a negative spotlight. The department has been rocked by allegations of racial profiling and the fatal police shooting of a mentally ill man. Johnson’s arrest comes just days after protesters marched into City Hall to express their anger over the shooting. The city and police department will move on from this incident, according to Miami Gardens Mayor Oliver Gilbert. Johnson’s arrest has caused stress on the job, and he apologized for his poor judgment. The expectations had been high for Johnson, a veteran cop, who came with 30 years of experience working in the public sector. He had made some strides in gaining favor with the community, but his arrest has caused a setback for the department. Johnson is also listed as a pastor at Bethel House of God Church in Hallandale Beach. Efforts to reach church officials were unsuccessful.\n"

      "Prediction: The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has been aggressively shutting off water service to delinquent residential customers, with 7,210 shut-offs in June alone. Activists have protested the shut-offs as an affront to human rights, criticizing the water department for ignoring commercial deadbeats. The DWSD has been accused of ignoring the debts of large entities while going after people who owe as little as $150 on their accounts. The water department says it needs to shut off the water to recoup some $175 million in outstanding bills. However, activists say that in a city with a poverty rate of 44 percent, and where water bills are higher than in much of the country, Detroit should work out a solution with poor residents instead of leaving them dry. The pressure seems to be partially working: DWSD announced a $1 million fund on Tuesday for residents struggling to pay. But even with the $1 million, activists say many others are likely to lose access to water over the summer. If the shut-offs continue, they say, DWSD can expect larger protests. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department announced plans to use $1 million from its Detroit Residential Water Assistance Program to help low-income customers avoid shutoffs. In May, about 46,000 notices were delivered to non-paying customers and water was cut off to about 4,500 of them. In total, officials report 90,000 city residents and businesses are behind on their water bills. The water department is reportedly responsible for about $6 billion of Detroit's $18 billion debt. Detroit congressman John Conyers sent off letters to Pres. Barack Obama, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Director and Chief Executive Office of the Detroit Water and Sewage Department Sue McCormick requesting \"immediate federal action\" in the form of funding for the problem. Nearly 50 picketed in Detroit outside of and blocked the gates of a company contracted by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to shut off water to delinquent customers beginning at 6:30 a.m.. Detroit police on Thursday arrested eight people, including religious leaders, who were protesting controversial water shutoffs for overdue bills in Detroit. The issue of Detroit customers, many of whom live below the poverty line, losing access to water has been call a civil rights issue and garnered national attention. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department announced plans to use $1 million from its Detroit Residential Water Assistance Program to help low-income customers avoid shutoffs\n"

      "Prediction: The news reports that Vladimir Katriuk, a 93-year-old former SS officer suspected of being part of a wartime massacre of civilians in Italy, has died due to dementia. The Russian Embassy in Ottawa had called on the Canadian government to support a criminal case against Katriuk, but Canada ignored the request and said it would never recognize Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine. Jewish groups have long urged the deportation of Katriuk, a former member of a Ukrainian battalion of the Waffen SS, and they increased their demands for action in recent years after new scholarly research that appears to tie Katriuk to a 1943 massacre of villagers in Belarus, a former Soviet republic. In 1999, the Federal Court ruled that Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretenses by not telling authorities about his collaboration with the Nazis but could find no evidence he committed atrocities. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke his citizenship. Katriuk has said he was forced to join the SS battalion and did not participate in operations with the Germans. He said that while in Belarus, he guarded villagers, livestock, and resources from other partisan forces. Moscow's new demand had threatened to reignite frictions between Canada's Jewish and Ukrainian communities over Katriuk. The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs urged Ottawa to take action on the Nazi collaborator, while the Ukrainian Canadian Congress called for Katriuk to be left alone. The Harper government pledged to re-examine the Katriuk case but nothing came of it.\n"

      "Prediction: Google CEO Sundar Pichai has been granted an equity award valued at nearly $200 million, making him one of the highest-paid executives in the US. The new award vests in quarterly increments over the next four years as long as Pichai is employed by Alphabet. The grant lifts the value of Pichai’s equity stake in Alphabet to more than $600 million. However, the award is still far short of the stakes held by co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt, Alphabet’s executive chairman, who was hired several years after the company started. Pichai’s award is worth more than the £130m ($187m) Google has grudgingly agreed to pay the UK government in back taxes since 2005. Critics of the controversial tax deal have calculated that Google generated sales of £24bn ($34.6bn) in the UK between 2005 and 2014 on which it has reported profit margins of between 25% and 30%, which works out an estimated profit of about £7.2bn ($10.4bn). As it already agreed to pay about £70m ($101m) in addition to the £130m ($187m) settlement, Google’s effective tax rate is between 2% and 3%, compared to the UK’s 20% headline corporation tax rate.

      "Prediction: Josh Hardy, a 7-year-old boy with a rare form of kidney cancer, has been given a potentially lifesaving drug after his parents and supporters campaigned for the drug company Chimerix to change its mind. Chimerix initially denied calls from the family to give Josh the drug, brincidofovir, arguing that spending time to help him would slow down efforts to get the drug on the market. However, after days of pleading, Chimerix worked with the FDA to expedite additional trials, and Josh will be the first recipient of the drug in a new trial set to start on Wednesday. The drug was on its way to Memphis on Tuesday night and could be administered to Josh on Wednesday morning. Josh's story drew national attention as his parents and supporters pushed the company to change its mind in online and media campaigns. The FDA policy known as \"compassionate use\" allows someone with a serious or life-threatening disease to ask a drug company for an experimental drug. Companies often say yes, but pharmaceutical companies often say no, as Chimerix did at first to Josh Hardy. The company had been in talks with the FDA, but could not reveal that because it did not want to get hopes up, Moch said. The drug was on its way to Memphis on Tuesday night and could be administered to Josh on Wednesday morning. A campaign through social media had erupted to flood Chimerix with phone calls and emails urging the company to change its mind about giving Josh a dose of the medicine he needs. Josh's story brought public attention to the impact of an adenovirus infection and the need for additional clinical development to assess the drug's potential. The company had been in talks with the FDA, but could not reveal that because it did not want to get hopes up, Moch said. The drug was on its way to Memphis on Tuesday night and could be administered to Josh on Wednesday morning.

The Hollywood Reporter has reported that Sizemore, who was 42 at the time, was told to leave the Utah set of a crime thriller called Born Killers (shot as Piggy Banks) after the child actress told her mother that Sizemore had touched her genitals during a photo shoot for the film. Despite his previous convictions for drug use and battery against women, Sizemore has never been accused of molestation before. The young actress, now 26, has recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against the actor as well as her parents. Sizemore has denied the young actress' claim and his management firm and talent agency dropped him shortly afterward. The incident has never been revealed publicly until now, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment-and-rape scandal. The film's producers removed Sizemore from the set as soon as they heard about the assertion, reviewed the photographs from the portrait session but found them to be inconclusive evidence and sought out the parents to encourage them to engage law enforcement if they felt compelled to do so. Sizemore has a history of alleged aggressive behavior toward women, most recently in February, pleading no contest to two misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse for assaulting his girlfriend in July 2016 in downtown L.A. He has also been charged with possession of methamphetamine in 2007 and appeared on Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew. Despite his rap sheet, he has worked steadily; his IMDb page lists 15 projects in 2018 alone.\n"

      "Prediction: The news passages describe the story of Linda Hooper, a teacher who adopted her former student Cruz Riojas, who was known as a \"holy terror\" in her classroom. Cruz had a reputation for frequent, violent outbursts and was considered a special education student due to his dyslexia. However, during his sixth-grade year with Hooper, he changed and started asking if he could help around the classroom. Hooper and her husband hired him to do odd jobs at their home and rental properties for cash, which helped him financially and gave him a sense of purpose. As a healthier relationship developed between Cruz and his teacher, the Hoopers' home became a refuge for the troubled student. When Cruz hurt his knee at school, emergency room doctors would not give him stitches without a parent or legal guardian present, which led Hooper to ask for permission to give him stitches. They also wanted to take Cruz on vacation to Fun Valley, Colorado, but would again need her signature. Hooper carried that paper everywhere, eventually laminating it to keep it from fraying. Cruz changed their lives, Hooper said, and in doing so, he changed the way she taught for 18 years after he left her classroom. She looked at students differently, thinking of them all as her Cruzes. Cruz changed his last name to Hooper in a formal adoption ceremony in 1998, and he and his wife, Anel, legally became part of the family. Cruz does well in his job for payroll company Corporate Solutions in San Antonio, and the Hoopers joke he could buy and sell them any day. He generally keeps quiet about his past, but he's getting there with his children. Cruz's story is one of perseverance and the power of love and support. \n",

      "Prediction: A nine-year-old boy named Kieran Sorkin was born without ears and had a rare condition that meant he did not have fully formed ears. However, thanks to several previous operations and a hearing aid, Kieran has gradually been able to hear. Kieran's parents helped him take a photograph of his newly crafted ear, or a \"side selfie.\" Kieran struggled at his first school because he looked different to the other children. He has since moved to a school with a deafness unit in every year group. Kieran's difficulties at school were due to him not fitting in with the other kids because he looked different. However, Kieran's new ears will boost his confidence and improve his performance at school. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kieran's surgery was primarily cosmetic, but it brings huge psychological benefits. Advances in tissue engineering mean that this kind of reconstructive surgery could be done quite differently within a decade. Scientists at the Institute of Child Health (ICH), part of University College London, are creating stem cells from patients' fat tissue. The Institute induces the cells to make cartilage or bone. Dr Patrizia Ferretti, leader of the ICH's Development and Regeneration Group, who is leading the study, said: \"This approach would be far less invasive for a child than the current method of harvesting a child's rib cartilage.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, scientists in the US implanted a human-like ear, grown from cow and sheep cells, onto a rat. However, such research is still at its early stages, and for the foreseeable future, children needing new ears will benefit from the same procedure used at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Kieran's first reaction to his new ears was \"Wow!\" and he started to giggle, but the operation on his ribs means it hurts when he laughs. Kieran will need a second operation in six months to make his ears stand out from the scalp more, but he's already delighted with the result.\n"

      "Prediction: President-elect Donald Trump has accused President Obama of putting \"roadblocks\" in his way, reversing his previous praise for the smooth transition. Trump took to Twitter to express his frustration, saying he was \"doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.\" Trump's assessment comes amid days of verbal sparring between the outgoing and incoming president. Trump is also perturbed by a number of steps the Obama administration is taking in its final weeks related to Israel, including a speech that was planned by Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Middle East policy. Trump's view of his Democratic predecessor soured earlier this week when Obama said on a podcast hosted by his former adviser, David Axelrod, that he thought he could have prevailed in an election over Trump. Trump also made it clear that he is highly critical of the Obama administration's refusal to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n",

      "John F. Kerry, America's top diplomat over the last four years, confronts a mixed legacy: a handful of successes coupled with searing defeats, especially in the Middle East. His inability to halt the carnage in Syria, or to block Russia's growing influence, ranks as the most serious blot on his record. But he also got nowhere trying to end the Israeli-Palestinian standoff, or to stop Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, from bombing civilians in Yemen. Kerry's greatest success was the historic accord to curtail Iran's nuclear development program and a landmark climate change treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming. \n",

      "Trump briefly emerged from Mar-a-Lago this afternoon and fielded a question from ABC News about whether the transition of power was going smoothly. Trump said, \"I think very, very smoothly, very good. You don't think so?\" Trump also said he will hold a press conference in early January. The president-elect has not held a full press conference since the election. Trump's tweet followed an interview in which Obama claimed that he would have won with his message of hope if he had faced off against Trump in the 2016 election. Trump addressed Obama's remark, saying, \"Nobody's ever going to know because we're never going to be going against each other in that way.\" Trump also said he had a \"nice conversation\" with Obama earlier in the day.

      "Prediction: A Chinese man, Guan Quanzhi, has won more than $80,000 in compensation after suing local government officials over an attack by a wild panda. The animal wandered into Liziba village in the northwestern province of Gansu, where local officials trying to capture it chased it onto Guan's land. The panda bit him in the leg and only released its grip when another villager covered its head with a coat. The incident in March last year left Guan with injuries requiring seven hours of surgery. Guan's son sued local forestry officials and the nearby Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to more than 100 wild pandas. Following \"negotiations\", officials agreed to pay compensation of 520,000 yuan ($83,000), his lawyer Wang Chaohui told AFP. Guan is \"satisfied with the amount\", which will cover his medical bills, he said, adding that he may need further operations. The giant panda's natural habitat mostly lies in mountainous southwestern China. They have a notoriously low reproductive rate and are under pressure from factors such as habitat loss. The number of wild giant pandas rose nearly 17 percent over the decade to 2013 to reach 1,864, state media cited an official survey data as saying this month, with a government agency crediting conservation measures for the increase. Pandas are a major generator of tourist revenue in several parts of China and for Beijing, which capitalizes on the global fascination with the animals by renting them to foreign zoos. They have been known to attack humans, including in 2008 when a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who climbed into its enclosure at a zoo in southern China. The nature conservation organization WWF says on its website: \"As cuddly as they may look, a panda can protect itself as well as most other bears,\" using its heavy weight, strong jaw muscles, and large molar teeth. It cautions: \"Although used mainly for crushing bamboo, a panda bite can be very nasty.\" \n",

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) has issued an Amber Alert and is offering a reward of $10,000 for information leading to the return of Carlie and the capture of Simpson. Two Knoxville banking executives, Matt Daniels and Tim Williams, have also offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to Carlie's return. The TBI has received over 1,200 leads and is pursuing tips on possible sightings of Carlie and Simpson in 11 states.

Jeff Glor will also be joining the team as a regular news reader, while Marysol Castro, formerly of ABC's \"Good Morning America\" weekend edition, will serve as a weather anchor. Smith will become the primary substitute anchor for Katie Couric's evening newscast, \"Face the Nation\" and \"Sunday Morning.\" The new team is set to start on January 3, and CBS News President Sean McManus believes that the chemistry between Wragge and Hill will work well together. The suddenness of the changes has raised questions about whether CBS is trying to shake things up, but McManus insists that the timing is right to start planning for the future. The changes come after \"The Early Show\" consistently ranked behind NBC's \"Today\" show and ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in the network morning news ratings. CBS News is discussing future roles at the network with Rodriguez and Price. Overall, the new team is expected to bring fresh energy and chemistry to the show, and CBS hopes that it will help the show grow and break out of third place.\n"

      "Prediction: George H.W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, passed away at the age of 94. He led the country to a swift victory in the Persian Gulf War and oversaw the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union and unification of Germany. Bush was a successful businessman, member of Congress, envoy to the United Nations and China, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Republican Ronald Reagan's vice president in 1980. He lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, after a campaign in which he was hampered by two years of disappointing economic performance and an insurrection among his own party's conservatives over a decision to raise taxes. In subsequent years, historians have been far kinder regarding the Bush presidency than were voters at the time. Bush also won some degree of vindication when his eldest son, George W. Bush, won the White House in 2000, making Bush the only American since John Adams to be both a president and father of a president. Bush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, and joined the Navy during World War II, becoming its youngest pilot. He married his girlfriend, Barbara Pierce, and finished his education at Yale, but eschewed the path to Wall Street that his family ties offered. Bush inspired generations of Americans to public service, and his wife, Barbara, championed the cause of improving literacy rates among Americans. Bush found a way to signal his unhappiness with the man who vanquished his son in the 2016 election, Donald Trump, by staying away from his party's 2016 convention. Bush's shining moment as vice president came in the aftermath of the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, when the president lay near death in the hospital and the nation seemed leaderless. Bush proved himself willing to use American military might elsewhere, taking military action in 1989 when he ordered the removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. Bush's approval rating approached 90% after success in the 100-hour Persian Gulf War, the greatest U.S. military victory since World War II. Bush's obituary highlights his devotion to family, especially his love of his wife, Barbara. Bush's legacy includes his leadership during the Gulf War and his efforts to bring about a \"new world order\" of international equilibrium. Bush's quotes include \"Read my lips: No new taxes,\" \"Freedom works,\" and \"Who would have thought that I would be working with Bill Clinton, of all people?\" Bush\n"

      "Prediction: Former football star and actor O.J. Simpson could be released from prison as early as October 1 if he is granted parole on Thursday. Simpson, who is currently serving a nine to 33-year sentence in Nevada prison for convictions related to a botched 2007 burglary in Las Vegas, will appear before a Nevada judge to make his case for parole. If granted, Simpson will be able to live on his NFL pension, which is an estimated $25,000 per month. However, the Brown and Goldman families are expected to renew their pursuit of the millions they're owed. Simpson's net worth was $10.8 million when he and Nicole Brown Simpson divorced in 1992, but money has seemingly been tight for him since the Nicole Brown murder trial. Despite being acquitted in the famous criminal case, he was found guilty in a subsequent civil suit and ordered to pay $33.5 million to the Brown and Goldman families in February 1997. Simpson's time behind bars hasn't diminished interest in him, and a documentary on him won an Oscar this year while a television series dominated the Emmys last year. However, Simpson needs to disappear from the public eye to avoid falling into the same toxic mentality that landed him in prison in the first place. Simpson's release from prison will only renew the rabid curiosity, and opinions were set hard and fast long ago, and nothing Simpson does after his release is likely to change them.

      "Prediction: Jamaican lawmakers have passed legislation that reduces possession of small quantities of marijuana to a petty offence and paves the way for a medical cannabis industry. The law makes possession of up to 2oz of marijuana a petty offence that could result in a ticket but not in a criminal record. Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted. The law paves the way for a licensing authority to be established to deal with regulating the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. The move by Jamaican lawmakers adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana and last year Colorado and Washington legalized personal use. On Tuesday, Alaska became the third US state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana for adults. In the Americas, Uruguay last year became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market. In Argentina, personal possession of marijuana was decriminalized under a 2009 Supreme Court ruling that jail time for small amounts of drugs violates the country's constitution. A law in Chile permits use of medical marijuana. The new law eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records. The legislation paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp. The move by Jamaican lawmakers is a big step in the right direction, but there's still a lot of work to do. The decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica is significant because it begins to correct decades of criminalizing tens of thousands of Jamaicans, mostly poor young black males, for possession of a little'spliff'.\n"

      "Prediction: AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed into the Java Sea on December 28, 2014, with 162 people on board. The airline was only authorized to fly that route on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, but it violated the terms of its license by flying on a Sunday. The cause of the crash remains unexplained, but bad weather appears to have been a factor. Search teams have found four large parts of the plane on the sea bed, including a significant part of the jet's body. The discovery of the wreckage, especially if it is largely intact, would greatly benefit the investigation. The search has been hampered by strong currents and big surf, scattering bodies and debris in all directions. The crash was the first fatal accident suffered by the AirAsia group. The airline's operating license in Indonesia may be revoked, and the Transport Ministry will investigate all AirAsia flights. The crash has been a heart-wrenching experience for family members, with local media covering every development and theory, many of which have proved to be untrue. The wait has been agonizing, but relatives are encouraged by reports that parts of the plane have been detected and hope that everyone on board will be retrieved. The search for debris involves sophisticated navy ships from Singapore, Russia, Malaysia, and the U.S. equipped with sonars for scouring the seabed to pinpoint the all-important black boxes and the wreckage. The hope is that the body of the plane will still be largely intact, speeding the investigation. The search is ongoing, and officials are hopeful that they will find many of the passengers and crew who were aboard the plane still strapped in their seats inside.\n"

      "Prediction: The article discusses the importance of habeas corpus, a legal procedure that prevents the government from holding individuals indefinitely without showing cause. The Founders of the United States believed that habeas corpus was essential to preserving liberty, justice, and democracy, and it was enshrined in the first article of the United States Constitution. However, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals detained at Guantánamo Bay and for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an \"enemy combatant.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, meaning someone who has lived in the U.S. for years could potentially be labeled an \"enemy combatant\" and then thrown into prison with no legal recourse to challenge their detention. The article also discusses a recent case in which a New York judge granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, which could force the university to release the primates and sway additional judges to do the same with other research animals. The article emphasizes the importance of defending the right to habeas corpus, as it erodes the very foundation of our legal and constitutional framework. \n",

      "Prediction: On February 21, 2013, a deadly shooting occurred on the Las Vegas Strip when someone in a black Range Rover opened fire on a Maserati, causing it to crash into a taxi that burst into flames, leaving three people dead and at least six injured. The incident began with a dispute in a hotel along the Strip, which spilled onto the streets. The Maserati sped off at a high rate of speed and the SUV followed. At a stoplight, gunshots were fired from the SUV, hitting the Maserati, which then plowed into a taxi cab that exploded in a fireball on impact. The cab driver and passenger were killed at the scene, and the Maserati driver was pronounced dead at a hospital. A passenger in the Maserati was among the injured. The SUV raced off and was being sought by officials who have contacted police authorities in three states to be on the lookout for the vehicle. The shooting was the talk of the area, even among the denizens of the night, such as Paul Pillat, who described himself as a homeless person who has been trawling the streets for years. He said he was known by his street name, Tumbleweed, and he was heading to a fast-food restaurant near the intersection about 4:20 a.m. when he heard the gunshots. The shooting was the latest in a series of violent incidents on the Strip since the beginning of the year. Two people were critically wounded in a shooting at a parking garage on Feb. 6, and a tourist was stabbed Saturday in an elevator at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. Despite the incidents, Las Vegas prides itself on being safe for visitors. The city has made arrests or identified suspects in each case.

      "Prediction: On July 13, 2015, a small plane carrying three passengers crashed in the North Cascades. The passengers were presumed dead, but one of them, Autumn Veatch, a 16-year-old girl, survived the crash and was found two days later. Autumn was hiking for a couple of days before she was picked up by a motorist who drove her to safety. The motorist took her to a general store in Mazama, where employees called 911. Autumn was taken to a hospital in Brewster for treatment of minor injuries. The fate of her two step-grandparents, who were also on board, remains unclear. The plane crashed and caught fire after flying into a bank of clouds. Autumn remained at the crash site for a day before deciding to hike down, eventually finding a trail and following it to the trailhead on Highway 20. Rescuers celebrated Autumn's survival, but they immediately returned their focus to finding the wreckage. The crashed plane crossed the Idaho-Washington border about 2:20 p.m. PDT Saturday, but it dropped off the radar near Omak, Washington, about an hour later. The last phone signal from one of the plane's occupants was detected around 3:50 p.m. Five aircraft equipped with special radios for detecting the missing plane's emergency-locator transmitter searched the mountains, while ground crews focused on areas between Mazama and Rainy Pass. The planes halted their search for the night by 8 p.m. while a couple of Navy helicopters from the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station continued to sweep the area.\n"

      "Prediction: The Gibson Guitar Corporation was raided by federal marshals in Tennessee, which is not the first time. The government is preparing to charge the company with trafficking in illegally obtained wood. The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband, according to a court motion filed in June. The Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. Gibson denies these allegations, maintaining that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. The Lacey Act is retroactive, causing concern among guitar builders who worry they might be forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago. The government has tried to create exemptions to cover vintage instruments, but they are rife with delays.

      "Prediction: Israel's cabinet has authorized the mobilization of up to 75,000 reservists in preparation for a possible invasion of Gaza after Palestinians fired a rocket towards Jerusalem for the first time in decades. The rocket attack on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, which is Israel's commercial center, has defied an Israeli air offensive that began on Wednesday with the aim of deterring Hamas from launching cross-border attacks that have plagued southern Israel for years. Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip, claimed responsibility for firing at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Israel said the rocket launched towards Jerusalem landed in the occupied West Bank, and the one fired at Tel Aviv did not hit the city. There were no reports of casualties. The siren that sounded in Jerusalem stunned many Israelis. The city, holy to Jews, Muslims, and Christians, was last struck by a Palestinian rocket in 1970, and it was not a target when Saddam Hussein's Iraq fired missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a four-hour strategy session with a clutch of senior ministers in Tel Aviv on widening the military campaign, while other cabinet members were polled by telephone on raising the mobilization level. Political sources said they decided to more than double the current reserve troop quota set for the Gaza offensive to 75,000. The move did not necessarily mean all would be called into service. Hours earlier, Egypt's prime minister, denouncing what he described as Israeli aggression, visited Gaza and said Cairo was prepared to mediate a truce. Officials in Gaza said 29 Palestinians - 13 militants and 16 civilians, among them eight children and a pregnant woman - had been killed in the enclave since Israel began its air strikes. Three Israeli civilians were killed by a rocket on Thursday. The Israeli military said 97 rockets fired from Gaza hit Israel on Friday and 99 more were intercepted by its Iron Dome anti-missile system. Dozens of Israeli bombing raids rocked the enclave, and one flattened the Gaza Interior Ministry building. In a further sign Netanyahu might be clearing the way for a ground operation, Israel's armed forces announced that a highway leading to the territory and two roads bordering the enclave of 1.7 million Palestinians would be off-limits to civilian traffic. Tanks and self-propelled guns were seen near the border area on Friday, and the military said it had already called 16,000 reservists to active duty. Netanyahu is favorite to win a January national election, but further rocket strikes against Tel Aviv, a free-wheeling\n"

      "Prediction: In recent news, a woman named Rachel Borch was attacked by a rabid raccoon while jogging in the woods near her home. The raccoon charged at her with its teeth bared and latched onto her thumb. Borch was able to drown the animal in a puddle by pushing its head underwater. The state's Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the raccoon tested positive for rabies. Rabies is caused by a virus that affects the brain and spinal cord and can cause death if left untreated. The Maine CDC reports that there have been 20 animals, including raccoons, red foxes, and skunks, that have tested positive for rabies in 2017. Borch has received six shots so far, including the rabies vaccine, and immunoglobulin and tetanus injections. She is slated to receive her last injection this weekend. The article also mentions that earlier this week, a Wiscasset man was bitten on both hands in Topsham by what was believed to be a rabid fox. The article emphasizes the importance of avoiding infected animals, even dead ones, because the rabies virus can live outside the body for 24 hours. Under Maine law, cats and dogs, even if they stay indoors, must be vaccinated against the disease.\n"

      "Prediction: NASA scientists have discovered that an ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold. The huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet’s surface, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth, and was a mile deep in places. In total, the ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water, or more than is found in the Arctic Ocean, the researchers found. The view of the planet’s ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago. Back then, flowing water was widely considered to have been a more erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only rarely, and never forming long-standing seas and oceans. The infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium. The high concentration means that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet’s frozen ice caps. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet’s surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth’s surface. The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. Last year, Nasa’s Curiosity rover detected methane in the Martian atmosphere. The finding sparked intense speculation that the gas might be coming from living organisms. It might, but there is no evidence to suggest it is. Methane is regularly produced on planets through geological processes without any need for life. The evidence continues to mount that Mars was once far wetter—and, since the water was mostly in liquid form rather than in the icy polar caps where it's now locked up, much warmer—than it is today. That, along with increasing signs that the ancient chemical environment was hospitable to biology, means support for the notion that life might once have existed on Mars is only getting stronger.\n"

      "Prediction: Charlotta Turner, a professor in Analytical Chemistry, received a text message from her student Firas Jumaah in 2014, asking her to assume he would not finish his thesis if he had not returned within a week. Jumaah and his family were hiding out in a disused bleach factory, with the sounds of gunshots from Isis warriors roaming the town reverberating around them. Jumaah, who is from Iraq, is a member of the ethno-religious group Yazidi hated by Isis. Turner contacted the university's then security chief Per Gustafson, who hired a security company that arranged the rescue operation. A few days later, two Landcruisers carrying four heavily-armed mercenaries roared into the area where Jumaah was hiding, and sped him away to Erbil Airport together with his wife and two small children. Jumaah's family survived Isis occupation, and he completed his PhD and now works for a pharmaceuticals company in Malmö. The family has almost finished paying the university back for the rescue operation. This is a unique event, as far as Turner knows, no other university has ever been involved in anything like it.

On an August day four years ago, Swedish chemistry professor Charlotta Turner received a surprising text message that would change the life of one of her graduate students. Firas Jumaah had returned to his native Iraq days earlier, fearing for the safety of his wife and two children who had traveled there for a family wedding. He had initially stayed behind to complete his lab work at Lund University in southern Sweden. While with his family in Iraq, Jumaah sent his supervisor a text message asking her to remove him from the doctoral program if he wasn’t back in Sweden within a week. Surprised by the message, Turner, 48, called Jumaah. It was then that she found out that his family was facing a life-and-death situation. Jumaah's family had returned to visit their home country of Iraq before violence began. But while he was there the so-called Islamic State conducted a deadly offensive in northern Iraq.

      "Prediction: Pippa Middleton, the sister-in-law of England's presumptive future king, has been caught up in a controversy after a male companion in a car pointed a gun at a photographer following them in Paris. The incident occurred hours after Pippa attended a decadent 18th century-themed party thrown by her close friend, the French aristocrat and designer Vicomte Arthur de Soultrait, on Friday. The driver of the car, who has yet to be identified, allegedly reached for a what appeared to be a semi-automatic gun and jokingly aimed it at a paparazzi following them. The image shows Middleton, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, looking back at the paparazzo and grinning as her friend, the driver, reaches down and aims what appears to be the gun. However, it has been reported that the excitement may have been overblown, as the photographer says he knew all along the gun was a fake and has been telling people he never felt scared. Even friends of one of the young fashionistas in the car told ABC News today that they have the toy gun in their possession. The French authorities are investigating the incident after receiving a complaint from a member of the public at a time when the capital is on high alert after a string of fatal shootings. If authorities want to prosecute, Pippa could be called as a witness. The crime itself carries a maximum seven-year jail sentence. The situation has the potential to cause acute embarrassment to the Royal Family as the Queen prepares to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee. The Royalist wrote about the challenges that Pippa faces as being a sort-of-member of the Royal Family in early March - she is more famous than Kate in some parts of the world but has no protection as she is not an HRH. The Palace is being incredibly short-sighted not to bring Pippa into the fold officially, perhaps by making her a lady-in-waiting which was originally mooted, but was then quietly dropped on the grounds she would attract too much media attention. The Royal Family are (albeit indirectly) responsible for the fact that she is famous, and she should be given the same protection and advice that other Senior Royals are being given. Pippa works as a party planner and is renowned for her assiduous development of society connections. She is clearly more in need of protection than, say, Princess Eugenie, and she, and her bottom, have certainly done as much for the reinvigoration of the Royal\n"

The article also notes that the female lead was a highly sought-after role, with many actresses vying for the part.

      "Prediction: The Mega Millions jackpot has reached a record-breaking $636 million, making it the biggest U.S. lottery prize in history. The jackpot is expected to grow even larger as ticket sales continue to surge, with 20 percent more tickets sold than expected over the weekend. The spending frenzy has pushed the prize closer to the record U.S. jackpot of $656 million, won in March 2012. If the winner chooses to take the lump sum cash option, instead of payments over 30 years, the jackpot would be $316 million. Ticket buying typically reaches a fever pitch the day of the drawing, with as much as 70 percent of tickets being bought on the day of the drawing. If no one picks the exact combination of numbers that appear on six randomly selected lottery balls, the prize will keep growing until the next drawing on Friday. The odds of winning are slim, but the more tickets sold, the better chance someone will match one of the 259 million possible number combinations that could land a jackpot. The spending tsunami has pushed the prize closer to the record U.S. jackpot of $656 million, won in March 2012. The second largest lottery jackpot was $590.5 million, won in May 2013 in a Powerball game. The jackpot is near the U.S. record, which was a $656 million Mega Millions prize, shared by three winning tickets in March 2012. If there's one winner, and the winner chooses the lump-sum cash option, the payout would be $341.2 million. Otherwise, the jackpot would be distributed over 30 annual payments. If no one wins Tuesday's jackpot, it will rise to at least $950 million for Friday's drawing. Ticket buying reached a fever pitch over the weekend, with 20 percent more chances sold than expected, according to Virginia's lottery director, Paula Otto. The spending tsunami pushed the prize closer to the record U.S. jackpot of $656 million, won in March 2012. The second largest lottery jackpot was $590.5 million, won in May 2013 in a Powerball game. The jackpot is near the U.S. record, which was a $656 million Mega Millions prize, shared by three winning tickets in March 2012.

      "Prediction: Ten volunteer firefighters from the Fairmont Rural Fire Department and the Orrum Fire Department in Robeson County, North Carolina have been arrested and charged with intentionally setting fires to abandoned homes and woods over a nearly two-year period. The investigation, which began after a tip, has resulted in approximately 90 arson-related charges, with more expected. The firefighters, who were arrested on Tuesday, are accused of setting numerous fires in woods and abandoned structures. The investigation involved the Robeson County Sheriff’s Office, State Bureau of Investigation, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the NC Forestry Service. The firefighters were charged with various counts of felony arson and conspiracy. More arrests are possible. The actions of the firefighters have cost taxpayers thousands of dollars. The investigation is not about any particular fire department, but rather individuals involved in the conspiracy. The locations of fires affected were various roads in Fairmont, including Eldorado Rd., Collins Mill Rd., Oakton Church Rd., Atkinson Road, Raynham Road, Reva Road, NC Highway 130, Main Street, Mitchell Rd., Davis Road, Happy Hill Road, Marion Stage Road, and Pleasant Hope Road. A friend of the firefighters expressed shock at the allegations, stating that the job might be boring at times, but you don't go creating fires just to have something to put out.\n"

      "Prediction: The European Court of Justice has dismissed appeals by both Nestle and Mondelez in a long-running legal battle over the shape of KitKat finger wafers. The ruling means that the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review a 2012 decision to uphold Nestle's trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit over objections raised by Mondelez. The Luxembourg court found that Nestle had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed an appeal by Mondelez against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016 that had found the EUIPO was wrong to reject the U.S. firm's complaint. The outcome leaves open that the trademark agency could, while respecting the judges' ruling, take account of other evidence - such as new proof the shape is distinctive to people in more countries - and might preserve protection for KitKat's shape. The case has been followed closely by trademark lawyers, who see implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. It has also at times featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat first marketed by Rowntree's, which was bought by the Swiss in 1988. In 2015, the Brexit-supporting Daily Express newspaper headlined a story on an earlier ruling: \"End of the KitKat?\" It said an EU \"diktat\" might \"spell the end of\" the wafer bars as the \"market could now be flooded with copycat confectionery.\" The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestle objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury, bought by the Americans in 2010, to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Swiss chocolatier Lindt applied for a trademark for its Easter bunnies with a red ribbon, which are iconic in many countries - but not all. In Germany, the Riegelein company also made gold-wrapped bunnies, and the case made it to both European and German courts - where Lindt eventually lost. And while Mondelez won the argument that you can't trademark the shape of a KitKat, it's sure you can trademark a Toblerone - which it owns. Toblerone's shape was registered in\n"

      "Prediction: The T. rex's roar has been a staple of dinosaur movies for decades, but new research suggests that dinosaurs may not have sounded like that at all. Instead, they may have made sounds closer to the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. The study, which analyzed the noises made by many living bird and crocodilian species, found that dino sounds may be what scientists call \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" These are low, throaty whooshes of air that are produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch. The researchers suggest that large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar vocal abilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study also found that closed-mouth vocalizations are unlikely to be ancestral in birds and have evolved independently at least 16 times within Aves, predominantly in large-bodied lineages. The researchers identified 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalization. They suggest that closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The study offers clues about what dinosaurs sounded like, as dinosaurs are members of the archosaur group, and many had large body sizes. The researchers suggest that some dinosaurs may have made closed-mouthed vocalizations in a manner similar to birds today, perhaps during mating displays. However, at this point in time, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the study sheds new light on the sounds that dinosaurs may have made, and suggests that they may have been much quieter and lower in pitch than previously thought. It also highlights the importance of understanding how living birds vocalize in order to make any sense of what nonavian dinosaurs sounded like.\n"

      "Prediction: Vanderbilt University has announced that it will pay $1.2 million to remove the word \"Confederate\" from one of its campus dorms. The private university has referred to the Confederate Memorial Hall simply as \"Memorial Hall\" since 2002, but was blocked in court from changing the name chiseled on the building because it was constructed with the help of a $50,000 gift from the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1933. Under the agreement, Vanderbilt will pay $1.2 million, the equivalent of the gift made 83 years ago, to the organization's Tennessee chapter. In exchange, the chapter will relinquish its naming rights to the building. Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos said the decision to remove the mention of the Confederacy from the building speaks to the courage of students, faculty, and staff who spoke out against it for years. The longstanding effort to rename the residence hall took on renewed urgency over the past couple of years, as universities across Tennessee and the country grappled with the shadow of racism and slavery on their campuses. The Southern Baptist Convention also voted to urge its congregations to stop displaying Confederate flags. Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro wants to remove the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings, but the proposal faces a tougher hurdle when it reaches the Tennessee Historical Commission. Calls to remove Confederate imagery from public places multiplied across the South after last year's slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. Republican Gov. Bill Haslam supported removing the Capitol bust of Forrest, who is famous for his exploits as a Confederate cavalry general and amassed a fortune as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis before the Civil War. The Forrest bust remains in the lobby between the House and Senate chambers at the state Capitol.\n"

      "Prediction: Lawyers for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have filed an appeal for a new trial, arguing that the trial should have been held outside of Boston due to widespread outrage over the bombing. The lawyers claim that even on social media, jurors would have seen friends and relatives posting about the 2013 bombing, making it impossible for Tsarnaev to receive a fair trial in the city. The appeal also argues that the recent Supreme Court ruling about the vagueness of the definition of a \"crime of violence\" throws many convictions into question. Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 federal charges in the bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260. He apologized at his sentencing. The appeal claims that \"continuous and unrelenting publicity\" about the bombings, the defendant and his family, and wrenching survivor stories prevented him from getting an impartial hearing. It notes that Boston announced a new holiday marking the bombings while jurors were deliberating Tsarnaev's guilt. As users of social media, the jurors would have found it impossible to avoid coverage, the appeal argues. The defense repeatedly asked for a change of venue before the trial began, but the requests were rejected by the judge. Despite the dramatic news from court, the Boston Marathon bomber’s fate will take years to reach its conclusion: only three of 340 prisoners sentenced to federal death row have been executed in the last 50 years. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has become the 62nd inmate on federal death row after he was sentenced to death on Friday for his part in the Boston Marathon bombings. He will now join the rarified group of men and women (two are female) awaiting execution on federal death row; at 21 he will be the youngest. The prisoner’s team of legal defenders, led by Judy Clarke, have already indicated two strong lines of likely appeal: that on prejudicial grounds the trial should never have been held in Boston where the bombings happened; and that the defense was given insufficient time to mount a full argument in mitigation that might have convinced the jury to spare Tsarnaev from the federal death chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana. Most capital cases in the US are handled by individual death penalty states, mainly in the deep south, while the involvement of the federal government in America’s most controversial judicial practice has become increasingly unusual in modern times. Although a total number of 340 prisoners have been executed by the US government since 1790, in the past 50 years only three have died: Timothy McVe\n"

      "Prediction: The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is set to be acquired by IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) in an $8.2 billion deal. The merger would create the world's largest exchange operator, with a combined market share of 40% in the trading of stocks and derivatives. The deal would also link NYSE Euronext to one of the industry's fastest-growing exchanges, ICE, which has some of the highest profit margins in the business. The takeover would seal the triumph of electronic trading over \"open outcry\" floor trading that long dominated financial markets, as well as the push by exchanges to embrace new and innovative technologies. The merger would also expand ICE, which despite its bigger market value is a smaller company, with a little more than 1,000 employees, while NYSE Euronext has 3,077. The takeover is expected to be announced as soon as Thursday morning, though talks may still break down. The deal represents a premium of 37% to NYSE Euronext's closing stock price on Wednesday. The trading of stocks has become a less attractive business, with the New York Stock Exchange responsible for only about 11% of all stock trading, while NYSE Euronext's electronic Arca platform accounts for another 12%. The average number of American stocks traded each day has fallen every year since 2009, and has continued to decline over the course of 2012, according to statistics from Credit Suisse. The volume of trading in futures and options, where ICE is focused, has also fallen since last year, but less than in stocks. The takeover would also expand ICE's reach into the over-the-counter trading of derivatives, including the Liffe market in London. The planned merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse fell apart early this year after European antitrust regulators opposed the combination, on the ground that it would corner too much of the market in exchange-traded derivatives. The takeover would also pose fewer problems because ICE focuses on commodities like oil, natural gas, and cotton, while NYSE Euronext plies mainly in stock and stock options and derivatives. The takeover is expected to be announced as soon as Thursday morning, though talks may still break down.

      "Prediction: Iran has delayed the trial of two American hikers, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, who were arrested near the Iraqi border in July 2009. The trial was scheduled to begin on Saturday, but the judiciary spokesman said that the trial could not go ahead as scheduled because of the absence of a third suspect, Sarah Shourd, who was arrested with the men but released on bail in September this year. The delay comes as Washington and other powers are trying to prod Tehran to return to talks this month about its nuclear activities. Iran has said it is ready to restart the talks which stalled last year, but has yet to agree a date and has even suggested the talks should not address the nuclear issue. The United States State Department has never suggested the version published by WikiLeaks, always maintaining that it did not know how their arrest happened. The American military report, by an anonymous official, also said, “The lack of coordination on the part of these hikers, particularly after being forewarned, indicates an intent to agitate and create publicity regarding international policies on Iran.” However, Ms. Shourd said that she was mystified by that conclusion. The three had no idea they were near the border and had not been warned about anything, she said. “Those claims are illogical and unsubstantiated. It is ridiculous to claim that mountain climbers would be agitating along a border.” The United States State Department has never suggested the version published by WikiLeaks, she said, always maintaining that it did not know how their arrest happened. The State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, confirmed that on Sunday. “We don’t know whether they had two feet on one side or the other or one foot on each,” he said. “All we know is Iran has held them far too long.”\n"

      "Prediction: Soldiers in Mali have overthrown the government, suspending the constitution and dissolving institutions. The coup was sparked by the government's handling of a Tuareg rebellion in the north, which has forced tens of thousands to flee. The mutinous soldiers have imposed a nationwide curfew and announced that they are taking control of the country. The whereabouts of President Amadou Toumani Toure are unknown, and a number of ministers have been arrested. The West African regional bloc ECOWAS has condemned the actions of the mutinous soldiers, describing them as \"reprehensible\" and \"misguided\". The Tuaregs, a traditionally nomadic people spread across the Sahara Desert, have risen up against the central government in Mali several times since the country's independence from France in 1960. The newest rebellion launched in mid-January broke years of relative peace, and has been fueled by the return of Tuaregs from Libya who had fought in Gadhafi's army. The government has not disclosed how many government soldiers have been killed. The unrest began on Wednesday as the country's defence minister started a tour of military barracks north of the capital. Soldiers fired in the air during the inspection, prompting an immediate strengthening of security around the presidential palace. Troops are upset with the government's handling of a Tuareg rebellion in the north of the country, and are also reportedly opposed to any potential talks with the rebels. The Kenyan government said its foreign minister, Moses Wetangula, and three officials accompanying him are safe in their Bamako hotel after being stranded in Mali. The US and France have urged the soldiers and government to resolve their dispute through peaceful means. A presidential election was due to take place in the country in just under a month. The government had so far refused to postpone the poll, despite the unrest involving Tuareg-led rebels.\n"

      "Prediction: The House Intelligence Committee has voted to release a classified memo that alleges misconduct by senior FBI officials involved in the Russia probe. The memo, written by Republicans, accuses the FBI and the Justice Department of improperly using government surveillance during the investigation into Russian election interference and contacts with President Donald Trump's campaign. The GOP-led panel voted along party lines to release the secret document and against making public a competing memo Democrats had crafted. The memo has been a source of escalating partisan tension in Congress, with Republicans arguing it shows wrongdoing by FBI officials involved in surveillance of a Trump campaign aide, while Democrats say it mischaracterizes intelligence and is an attempt to distract from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The memo accuses senior FBI officials of abusing a classified surveillance program, known as FISA, to spy on a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The GOP has complained that the FBI included in its evidence material culled from a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that described illicit connections between Trump and Russia. The memo also reveals that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved an application to extend the surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in early 2017. The White House said earlier on Monday that no decision would be made until lawmakers voted.

President Trump now has five days to either object to the committee's request or clear the way for the memo's release. The memo has been a source of escalating partisan tension in Congress, with Republicans arguing it shows wrongdoing by FBI officials involved in surveillance of a Trump campaign aide, while Democrats say it mischaracterizes\n"

      "Prediction: The US and China are locked in a trade war, with the US planning to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. China has warned that it will retaliate if the US imposes new trade penalties. The US has already imposed 25% tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, and China responded with its own tariffs on US goods worth $34 billion. The US is trying to secure certain concessions from China, and if China agrees, the US may back off additional tariffs. The US and China are trying to restart talks aimed at averting a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The US and China have struggled to find a starting place for a new round of talks. The US has privately expressed dismay to the highest levels of the Chinese government that the ZTE deal fell through. The Politburo signaled that policy makers will focus more on supporting economic growth amid risks from a campaign to reduce debt and the dispute with Trump. The US and China remain locked in a trade war, with talks between US and Chinese officials having done little to ease tensions.\n"

      "Prediction: Sony has introduced the PlayStation 4, a next-gen platform designed to shift focus from the living room to the gamer. The PS4 is an advanced, x86-based personal computer, which means that it should be easy for developers to build. The hardware is clearly also borrowing some tricks from mobile games. It has save states that allow users to quickly freeze and resume gameplay, without having to save just by switching on and off the console. There’s also background downloading, which allows digital titles to be played before they’re even completely on your local drive. Social is another key tentpole for the PS4, according to Cerny. He described a new function that allows you to quickly pause and upload gameplay videos as easily as you might have done with static screenshots in the past. There’s also spectator functionality for watching “celebrities” gaming, something which seems to have been borrowed from Twitter’s success with famous members. Networking will also be based around real names and profile pictures, instead of strictly on gamer tags and avatars, too, and all of this will plug into mobile apps to help gamers stay in touch. \n",

      "Prediction: Researchers from UC Berkeley have made a breakthrough in decoding brain activity to reconstruct YouTube videos. The team used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines to record the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex of their subjects as they watched two sets of movie trailers. The brain activity was then fed into a computer to program a \"movie reconstruction algorithm,\" which matched neural activity to what was taking place in the video. The algorithm learned to associate certain neural patterns with dynamic information against 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos. The result is a continuous, if abstract, reconstruction of the actual videos. This is believed to be a first for reading a dynamic visual experience. The technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery, the scenes that play out inside our minds independent from vision. The researchers say the technology could also be used to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analog, like dreams. The brain activity measured in this study is just a fraction of the activity that lets us see moving images. Other, more complex areas help us interpret the content of those images. The researchers hope to look at more visual modules and build models for every single part of the visual system. The technology could one day allow people who are paralyzed to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. The potential to watch a person's memories may not be so far off. Whether such memories could be used in a court of law, however, would be limited not only by the technology but also the nature of memories. \n",

      "Prediction: Sen. Elizabeth Warren grilled Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf over the cross-selling scandal that has engulfed the bank. She called for a criminal investigation into Wells Fargo executives and told Stumpf he should resign. Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" and said that reform won't come to the industry until executives are sent to jail. The decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital has been met with predictable criticism. Pope Francis called on the United States to respect the status quo in Jerusalem, and the U.S. has historically insisted that Jerusalem's status be resolved in peace talks. The decision comes amidst a broader shift in Middle East politics, with Saudi Arabia and the United States growing closer to Israel. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presented Mahmoud Abbas with a peace plan that would be more tilted toward the Israelis than any ever embraced by the American government. The Palestinians would get a state of their own but only noncontiguous parts of the West Bank and only limited sovereignty over their own territory. The vast majority of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which most of the world considers illegal, would remain. The Palestinians would not be given East Jerusalem as their capital and there would be no right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants. The Saudis have denied the contents of the report. Violent protests are expected in response.\n"

      "Prediction: An anonymous hacker has released the first 10 episodes of season 5 of Netflix's hit series \"Orange Is The New Black\" online, after the streaming service allegedly failed to respond to the cybercriminal's shakedown demands. The hacker, who uses the handle \"thedarkoverlord,\" published the premiere episode from the upcoming season of \"Orange Is the New Black\" on Friday to the Pirate Bay. The hacker has also claimed to have stolen unreleased shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic, and IFC. Netflix has set June 9 for the release of season five of \"Orange Is the New Black.\" The hacker has demanded an unspecified sum of money from Netflix, and has threatened to release all the new episodes if the ransom is not paid. The hacker has also claimed to have stolen series from other studios, too, by breaking into a single company. The motive for purloining and leaking \"OITNB\" could be more about bragging rights in the cybercrime underworld.

Bayesian inference formalizes what will seem like common sense, allowing for the assessment and assignment of probabilities to new situations. Bayesian hunters must quantify subjective judgment, using expert testimonies and imagination. The article also discusses the challenges of finding basic information about which areas have already been searched and the subjectivity inherent to the approach. The article also mentions the success of Bayesian techniques in locating an Air France plane in 2011, which was missing for two years.

      "Prediction: Twin blasts targeting Syria's army command headquarters rocked the capital on Wednesday, setting off hours of sporadic gunbattles and a raging fire inside the heavily guarded compound, state-run media and witnesses said. The explosions were the latest to hit the Syrian capital as the country's civil war intensified and appeared to show the deep reach of the rebels determined to topple President Bashar Assad's regime. The explosions were caused by a car bomb and an explosive device that went off near the army command buildings. The army statement said no military commanders or personnel were hurt in the explosions, but Iranian Press TV said one of its correspondents, 33-year-old Maya Naser, a Syrian national, died in an exchange of fire in the area following the blasts. Over the past few months, rebels have increasingly targeted security sites and symbols of regime power in a bid to turn the tide in the fighting. On July 18, rebels penetrated the heart of Syria's power elite, detonating a bomb inside a high-level crisis meeting in Damascus that killed three top regime officials, including Assad's brother-in-law and the defense minister. Other large blasts have targeted the headquarters of security agencies in the capital, killing scores of people this year. Syria's conflict was the focus of attention as world leaders gathered at the U.N. General Assembly's annual meeting in New York this week. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon demanded international action to stop the war in Syria, telling a somber gathering of world leaders Tuesday that the 18-month conflict had become \"a regional calamity with global ramifications.\" Press TV and Al-Alam Damascus Bureau Chief Hosein Mortada also came under attack and was injured. \n",

      "Prediction: On Saturday, August 11, a decomposing body was found inside a column at a supermarket in Lancaster. The body of an adult male was discovered after a store manager complained about a strong smell. A plumber was called and a couple of bricks were broken to look inside the pillar. When they did that, they looked down and they could see a shoe and a leg down there at the bottom of the column – inside the column. The grim discovery was made around 2:40 p.m. The business — a WinCo supermarket — is located in the 700 block of West Avenue K in Lancaster. Police believe the man inside the pillar was someone law enforcement was chasing on Monday and lost. They believed that man ran into the WinCo and believe at some point he must have gotten into the crawl space before falling into the pillar.

The person found dead was not an employee of the store adding conjecture that the victim was indeed the chase suspect.

The U.S. Olympic Committee has declined to discuss the details of security for American athletes, but at least part of the American contingent for Sochi, the skiing and snowboard teams, has hired a private company, Global Rescue, for additional security. The company promises communications help, \"rally points\" for athletes to shelter in place, and ways to get them around or out of Sochi.

Other American athletes say their minds are on getting ready for competition. The terror threat is higher than at any previous Olympics, and the U.S. government has sent FBI agents to Sochi and Moscow for the duration of the Games and made air and naval assets available to help Russia prevent possible terror attacks.

      "Prediction: Robert Durst, a real estate scion, has been sentenced to seven years in prison for a federal gun crime in New Orleans. The 73-year-old pleaded guilty to the charge in February and has been held in Louisiana since his arrest in March 2015. Durst has been accused of several crimes, including the murder of his friend Susan Berman in 2000, and the dismemberment killing of a male neighbor in Texas in 2003. He has also been suspected of killing his first wife, Kathleen Durst, in New York in 1982. Durst has maintained his innocence in all of these cases and has repeatedly stated that he wants to prove his innocence. He is expected to be transferred to California within four to six weeks to face a murder charge in connection with Berman's death. Durst's attorneys have requested that he be housed at a low-security federal prison facility on the Pacific coast while he awaits state prosecution for Berman's murder. The gun charge stemmed from a search of Durst's hotel room in New Orleans, which turned up a loaded Smith and Wesson.38-caliber revolver, authorities said. Following his guilty plea in February, prosecutors had recommended a sentencing range of just 12 to 18 months on the gun charge. However, the deal also includes stipulations that authorities in New York won't prosecute him over financial maneuvering while on the lam, and that prosecutors in Texas and New Orleans won't pursue further gun counts against him related to his stay in New Orleans. Durst's attorneys have cited his \"advanced age and poor health\" in their request for him to be housed at FCI Terminal Island, a federal prison with medical facilities near Los Angeles. \n",

Durst is charged in California with killing his friend Susan Berman in 2000. His attorneys have said repeatedly that Durst is innocent, doesn't know who killed Berman, and wants to prove it. The most recent such statement was in a motion Monday asking U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt to recommend that Durst serve his time at Terminal Island, California, about 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles, where Durst faces trial\n"

State Department officials on an emergency conference call during the Benghazi attack brought up concerns about whether Marines that might have been deployed should wear uniforms — something officials previously said could hurt diplomacy in the region, according to House Benghazi investigators. The final GOP-authored House Benghazi report released Tuesday included new details of a two-hour video teleconference call the night of the attack, a session led by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. Clinton and top Defense officials were also on the call, which was supposed to center on how to get Americans out of harm's way. The report also found that a State official brought up a question about whether Marines should wear civilian clothing instead of their uniforms. Under secretary of State for management Patrick Kennedy told investigators he wanted to ensure that security was enhanced, not hurt by flags on the uniforms of any U.S. military presence. The military never deployed to Benghazi. State Department deputy spokesperson Mark Toner in a statement said the clothing issue did not affect the speed or timeliness of any possible military response. \n",

The new details emerged in a daylong pretrial hearing for Matthew, who is charged with capital murder in Graham's 2014 disappearance and death. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Matthew also faces first-degree murder charges in the 2009 death of 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington. He is serving a life prison term for a 2005 attempted murder and sexual assault in northern Virginia. The hearing lasted for several hours, with the judge ruling that there were no \"instances of deliberate misstatements and reckless disregard\" of the truth in the affidavit supporting the search warrant. The judge also noted that although the dog's findings may have had inconsistencies, there were other arguments in the six-page affidavit that could constitute probable cause. The hearing is ongoing, and the judge is expected to make a decision on whether the search warrant should have been issued. \n",

      "Overall, the hearing provided new insights into the investigation and the evidence against Matthew.

      "Prediction: Shannon Egeland, a convicted white-collar criminal, was sentenced to an additional three years and 10 months in prison for his role in an elaborate insurance scam. The scam was part of a staged insurance fraud that he concocted a day before he was due to start serving a decade-long federal prison term from a high-profile mortgage fraud case. Egeland directed his son to shoot him in the leg with a shotgun, hoping to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a bogus disability insurance policy that he had applied for seven days earlier. The shooting came one week after he applied for disability insurance. As a result of the gunshot, Egeland had his left leg amputated. The judge urged him to get mental health treatment and counseling while in prison, and to submit to a new mental health evaluation when he gets out of custody. Egeland had previously pleaded guilty to fraud charges for his role in the Desert Sun housing scandal that rocked Central Oregon in 2009. He was a co-owner of Desert Sun, which raised millions from local banks through a series of phony business plans and falsified loan applications. Authorities say he raised millions from local banks through a series of bogus business plans and falsified loan applications. Egeland came up with the trumped-up shooting plan to delay his prison sentence in the mortgage fraud case and benefit from fraudulently obtained disability insurance. He had his teenage son obtain a 20-gauge shotgun, while Egeland got the ammunition and directed his son to shoot him in the legs on July 31, 2014. Seven days earlier, Egeland had submitted an application for a disability insurance policy to Standard Insurance, falsely claiming he had never been arrested or indicted for either a felony or misdemeanor in the prior 10 years, according to court records. Standard Insurance did not suffer an actual loss because the fraud was quickly detected. If Egeland had died in the stunt \"the minor child would have been left to deal with the consequences\", the assistant US attorney added. A prosecutor described Egeland in a sentencing document as a \"menace to society\".\n"

      "Prediction: On March 23, a fatal accident occurred involving a Tesla Model X, which crashed into a barrier on the 101 Highway near Mountain View, California. The driver, Walter Huang, died in the accident. Tesla confirmed that the vehicle was on autopilot at the time of the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is still investigating the accident. Tesla stated that the seriousness of the accident was due to the barrier not being repaired after a previous accident. The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) is responsible for maintaining the barriers and released a statement saying that replacement work was scheduled. Huang's brother claimed that he had complained about the Tesla's Autopilot \"seven to 10 times\" before the accident. The fatal crash comes after a woman was killed by one of Uber's autonomous vehicles in Tempe, Arizona, leading to increased scrutiny of autonomous vehicles. Tesla stated that its autopilot \"unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists.\" \n",

      "Prediction: Robin Williams, the beloved actor and comedian, passed away at the age of 63. He was known for his edgy comedy and dramatic turns, but he had a particular impact on the younger generation. Williams shifted his career in the 1990s to entertain children, and his filmography in the 1980s and early 1990s is full of prestige projects. However, it was his role as the Genie in \"Aladdin\" that had the most impact on people in their mid-to-late 20s and early 30s. Williams was generous enough to erase his recognizable face and body entirely, and yet as a blue drawing, he was more vivid and lifelike than the vast majority of TV characters. He was also known for his physical comedy in movies like \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" where he buried his face under makeup and his body in a fat suit. Certain themes emerged in his movies, such as playing a voice actor who's too childlike to sustain his marriage to Sally Field, or a man who'd been trapped inside a board game since childhood and who'd never lived in the real world. Williams got interested in serious projects again, but the mid-budget adult drama was beginning its disappearance. Despite this, Williams' legacy can be measured in the imprints his movies left in rec-room carpets, as kids parked in front of the TV rewound his movies again and again. Williams was a complex and brilliant individual, and his encounters with people left a lasting impression. He was a stand-up comedian of genius, and even when he transformed into a formidable actor, he was always searching for experience and knowledge. Williams' death has left a void in the entertainment industry and in the hearts of his fans.\n"

      "Prediction: The US ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, visited the city of Hama to show support for the Syrian people fighting for democracy. The city has been wracked with violence and a general strike this week after a series of peaceful demonstrations, including a huge anti-government demonstration last Friday. President Bashar al-Assad fired the Hama provincial governor and security forces removed tanks to the outskirts of the city, a sign that tensions there could be easing. Ford met with over a dozen Hama residents and visited a hospital that has treated some of those wounded in the security forces crackdown. The Syrian government accused Washington of \"interfering\" in its affairs, but the US state department said that Ford's visit was to make clear that they stand with those Syrians who are expressing their right to speak for change. The opposition reported 13 protesters killed, including five deaths in the central city of Homs, two in the capital's commercial neighbourhood Midan and six in the Dumair area, east of Damascus. An estimated 1,000 Syrians have fled Hama in fear of another military crackdown on protests calling for Assad to quit and an end to the Baath Party's decades-long grip on power. The situation in Hama is calm, according to a state-run newspaper, and authorities have told demonstrators to avoid any confrontations and clear the streets so residents could go to work. Hama has been a symbolic city of opposition since the 1982 crackdown on a revolt by the banned Muslim Brotherhood against then-president Hafez al-Assad, father of the current leader. At least 20,000 people are believed to have been killed in the crackdown. There has also been violence in the city of Hasrata just outside Damascus where three people have been killed and nine injured by security forces. Government troops surrounded the Hassan mosque on Thursday and fired at people coming out after prayers, according to reports. Diplomats said that French ambassador Eric Chevallier was also in Hama to show support. The US state department summoned the Syrian ambassador for talks this week after reports that embassy staff had filmed US protests against the crackdown in Syria. Ambassador Imad Mustapha was called in to meet with top State Department officials \"to express a number of our concerns with the reported actions of certain Syrian embassy staff in the United States\".\n"

      "Prediction: The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating an attempt to hack into the Democratic National Committee's voter database. The DNC was alerted by a cloud service provider and a security research firm that a fake login page had been created in an attempt to gather usernames and passwords that would allow access to the party's database. The DNC and the two companies involved in detecting the operation say they believe they thwarted a potential attack. The fraudulent page was designed to look like the access page Democratic Party officials and campaigns across the country use to log into a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the database. The DNC believes it was designed to trick people into handing over their login details. This incident highlights the constant threats to the upcoming midterm elections and the need to remain vigilant to prevent future attacks. The cyber age has changed elections forever, and so many systems are vulnerable to manipulation that the opportunities for foreign and domestic manipulation are many. Political groups and government organizations have been on high alert for new hacks and foreign meddling. Microsoft has detected that hackers tied to Russian intelligence targeted the Senate and conservative think tanks in the United States, also by creating fake websites.

      "Prediction: On Monday, the Boston Marathon was marred by two explosions at the finish line, resulting in the deaths of three people and injuring over 170 others. The victims included Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy from Dorchester, Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager from Medford, and a Boston University graduate student from China who was watching the race with two friends near the finish line. The explosions caused chaos and panic, with bloodied spectators being carried to a medical tent intended for runners. The race was stopped and the marathon headquarters were locked down, while the Federal Aviation Administration announced a temporary flight restriction over Boston. Despite the tragedy, there were small signs of a return to normalcy on Tuesday, with planes, trains, and automobiles running at or near normal operating schedules. The city of Boston has shown strength, compassion, and determination to see justice done, according to District Attorney Daniel Conley. President Obama praised first responders and others who helped the injured, saying that if you want to know who America is, how they respond to evil, that's it: selflessly, compassionately, unafraid. The president will travel to the city on Thursday for an interfaith service. Pope Francis sent word to Cardinal Sean O'Malley, archbishop of Boston, that he was \"deeply grieved\" by the bombings and prayed that all would be \"united in a resolve not to be overcome by evil, but to combat evil with good, working together to build an ever more just, free and secure society for generations yet to come.\" The tragedy has brought words of encouragement and solidarity from across the nation and around the world.\n"

      "Prediction: The world is facing a growing obesity problem, with almost 30% of the global population now either obese or overweight. The USA leads the world in obesity, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, but other countries are also struggling with weight issues. Obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. It is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers. Chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually. The problem is not limited to rich nations, as obesity now grips people of all ages, incomes, and regions. Not one country has succeeded in cutting its obesity rate. The Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands have reached staggeringly high obesity rates. The richest country, the United States, was home to the biggest chunk of the planet's obese population - 13% - even though it claims less than 5% of its people. Obesity is appearing at increasing young ages, rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide. Men tallied higher rates in developed countries, while women did so in developing countries. There was a possible ray of hope in rich countries, with the rate of increase in adult obesity slowing in the past eight years. More than half of the world's obese live in just 10 countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions. A report is due in early 2015.\n"

      "Prediction: Billionaire Barry Sherman and his wife Honey were found dead in their Toronto mansion last Friday. The couple's deaths have been deemed \"suspicious\" by police, who have now taken over the investigation. The influential couple were found hanging from a railing partly surrounding their basement lap pool. The police source previously told CBC News that someone outside the Sherman family discovered the bodies, but police remain tight-lipped about the investigation. As questions mount about the cause of the deaths, some news outlets are quoting police sources, saying the case is being investigated as a murder-suicide. However, the couple's grown children dismissed outright the suggestion that a murder-suicide was behind the deaths. The family released a statement saying that their parents shared an enthusiasm for life and commitment to their family and community, which is inconsistent with the rumours regrettably circulated in the media as to the circumstances surrounding their deaths. The couple had four children and had recently welcomed a new grandchild. Barry Sherman founded Apotex in 1974 and has amassed a vast fortune since. His net worth was recently estimated by Canadian Business magazine at $4.77 billion, making him the 15th richest person in the country. The couple had listed their home at 50 Old Colony Rd. in Willowdale near Bayview Avenue and Highway 401, shortly before they died, for $7 million. Friends, employees, and well-wishers have been dropping off flowers in honour of the Shermans. Barry was described as a reserved man, but a man who, over his business career, created hundreds and hundreds of jobs for people in the city of Toronto. Honey was described as a dedicated philanthropist. She was a member of the board of the Baycrest Foundation and the York University Foundation. She also served on the boards of Mount Sinai's Women's Auxiliary, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the International American Joint Distribution Committee. The couple's deaths have left the Canadian business community and the Jewish community in Toronto reeling. The police have not yet released any further information about the investigation.\n"

      "Prediction: Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with Islamist groups expected to consolidate their gains from earlier rounds. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party is leading ahead of the more conservative Nour party, which represents Salafi Muslims. The final stage of the vote covers nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates. The election and former President Hosni Mubarak's trial take place amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they won't cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. The new parliament will witness political struggles between the military council, the Brotherhood, and Salafis, and the revolutionary forces. Economic growth has slowed as the unrest deters tourists and investors. Foreign-currency reserves declined by 44 percent to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index lost 49 percent last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets tracked by Bloomberg. The Brotherhood's party, Freedom and Justice, started the day with nearly 50 percent of the seats awarded in the first two rounds of the vote. The final nine governorates voting on Tuesday included the historic Brotherhood strongholds of Gharbiya and Daqahliyya in the Delta, where a number of the group's best-known candidates are running. The Brotherhood has played down its electoral strength before, but winning a clear majority would enable the Brotherhood's party, if it chose, to govern without forming a coalition. The Brotherhood has so far sought to ally itself with the liberals rather than the most conservative Islamists and has reiterated that it has no plans to form an all-Islamist government. Winning a clear majority would reduce the clout of the ultraconservatives, known as Salafis, who have so far come in second-place in the first two rounds of the voting, winning as much as 25 percent of the seats by most estimates. The Brotherhood has said repeatedly that it intends to form a coalition or unity government, in part to avoid unnerving Egyptian liberals or Westerners who may fear an Islamist takeover. The lower house of Parliament is Egypt's primarily legislative body, and Field Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the top military officer who is now acting as de facto chief executive, has scheduled its first session for Jan. 23, two days before the anniversary of the outbreak of protests that ousted Mr. Mubarak.

The car left the lane of traffic while westbound on Route 4 in Mendon, when a GPS device gave sudden directions to turn around, because the car had passed its intended destination. Altahan reacted quickly to the directions, left the road and the car ended up suspended on the guy wire. Fortunately, Altahan and her passenger were not injured in the incident. A witness at the miniature golf course said she saw the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole. State police responded, as did Rutland City Fire Department. This incident highlights the importance of being cautious when using GPS systems and following directions carefully. It also emphasizes the need for drivers to stay focused on the road and avoid distractions while driving. \n",
